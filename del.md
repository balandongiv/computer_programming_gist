# IoT-Enabled Smart Nest Monitoring and Environmental Control System for Sea Turtle Conservation in Sabah, Malaysia

## Part 1: Understanding the Issue – The Problem Statement

### 1.1 The Critical Role of Temperature in Sea Turtle Incubation

Sea turtles exhibit **temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD)**, meaning the incubation temperature of the eggs dictates the sex of the hatchlings. Each species has a **pivotal temperature** (around \~29 °C for many sea turtles) that produces an approximately 1:1 male-to-female ratio. Even slight deviations from this optimal range can cause dramatic sex ratio skews. For example, at just **0.5–1 °C above the pivotal temperature, the vast majority of hatchlings will be female (often >80–90%)**, whereas cooler nests yield more males. In practice, a nest maintained even slightly above 30 °C during the middle third of incubation can become almost entirely female-producing. Such sensitivity means that **small temperature changes can upset the demographic balance** of sea turtle populations, emphasizing how critical thermal conditions are during incubation.

Temperature doesn’t only affect sex – it also **impacts hatching success and hatchling health**. Sea turtle embryos incubate best within a moderate temperature range (roughly \~26–33 °C); outside this range, developmental problems and mortality rise sharply. **Prolonged extreme temperatures (especially above \~34–35 °C)** are often lethal to embryos, leading to sharply reduced hatching success. High-temperature incubation has been scientifically shown to cause elevated embryo mortality: for instance, an experimental study in Cape Verde found that a “warm” incubation treatment (mean \~32.3 °C) **killed \~33% more embryos** than a cooler 29.7 °C treatment. Elevated incubation temperatures also produce weaker hatchlings – in the same study the warmer regime yielded predominantly female hatchlings that were **smaller in size and exhibited lower performance** (slower movement, weaker vigor) compared to those from the cooler regime. As a consequence, more of the warm-incubated hatchlings fell prey to predators (e.g. ghost crabs) during their crawl to sea, further reducing their survival. In fact, when combining the losses from embryo mortality and immediate post-hatchling predation, the researchers found that **the number of female hatchlings successfully reaching the ocean was over twice as high in the cooler incubation group** than in the warm group (34.4 vs 16.0 females per 100 eggs). This stark result indicates that any “extra” females produced by hotter nests come at a severe cost to survival – **extreme heat nullifies the potential reproductive benefit of a female-biased sex ratio**.

Beyond outright mortality, incubation temperature influences the **developmental normality and fitness of hatchlings**. Extreme thermal conditions can act as a teratogen, leading to congenital developmental abnormalities in embryos that do survive. Research has documented that **temperature-induced malformations** in sea turtle embryos can include neural tube defects, **craniofacial malformations** (e.g. orofacial defects), **eye abnormalities**, malformed limbs, and internal organ developmental issues. Such deformities (though relatively rare) tend to occur when eggs experience sustained high temperatures beyond the tolerable range during critical development windows. Moreover, **physiological stress** is elevated in hatchlings from overheated nests. Field studies using blood analysis have detected signs of **dehydration and inflammatory stress in hatchlings from nests that incubated at abnormally high temperatures**, compared to hatchlings from cooler, more optimal nests. These sub-lethal effects – dehydration, inflammation, and other altered blood analytes – suggest that even if hatchlings emerge, those from hot nests may be starting life at a physiological disadvantage.

Finally, incubation temperature affects **hatchling quality and performance**, which are crucial for survival in the early life stages. High sand temperatures tend to produce **smaller, weaker hatchlings**. Because development speeds up at higher temperatures, embryos often don’t fully absorb their yolk before hatching, resulting in smaller body size and less residual energy reserves. In sea turtles, a larger body size and well-developed musculature directly translate into better locomotor performance – faster crawling on the beach and stronger swimming ability once in the water. Conversely, smaller hatchlings from hot nests typically have reduced locomotor capacity. Studies have shown that **larger hatchlings have better crawling and swimming performance** (e.g. faster crawl speed and more vigorous swimming strokes) which is critical for evading the intense predation gauntlet hatchlings face in their scramble from nest to sea. Therefore, nests incubated at high temperatures can produce hatchlings that are not only female-skewed in sex but also physically disadvantaged – slower off the mark, less likely to evade predators, and potentially less likely to survive their early ocean journey. In summary, **temperature is a master variable** for sea turtle reproductive success: it determines offspring sex, survival, and fitness. Even slight increases can tip sex ratios towards all-female cohorts, and **extremes can cause developmental harm or death**, underscoring the vulnerability of sea turtle populations to thermal conditions.

### 1.2 The Impact of Climate Change on Beach Temperatures

**Global climate change is directly affecting the thermal profiles of sea turtle nesting beaches**, compounding the challenges outlined above. Over the past century, rising air and sea surface temperatures have led to warmer sands in many nesting areas. A recent global analysis of 64 nesting sites found that **40 of those beaches have experienced significant warming trends**, with an average increase of about +0.85 °C per century in air temperatures (and some sites warming **as much as +2.5 °C per century**). In practical terms, many rookeries – especially in tropical regions – are now experiencing sand temperatures during incubation season that are higher than in the past. Already, researchers are observing shifts in hatchling sex ratios attributable to this warming. **Female-biased sex ratios are being recorded at the majority of monitored sites**: in the global survey, 57 out of 64 sites produced more females than males, and **at 17 sites the hatchlings were over 90% female on average**. Notably, some of the historically warmest rookeries (e.g. in the northern Great Barrier Reef, Australia, and certain beaches in the Middle East and Caribbean) are now reporting *extreme* feminization. For instance, **Raine Island in Australia’s GBR has been producing \~99% female green turtles in recent years**, a situation mirrored in other locations (90–97% female hatchlings at certain sites in Cyprus and the Caribbean) that have experienced strong warming. These findings alarmingly suggest that **climate change is already skewing the demographics of some sea turtle populations toward nearly all-female**.

If such skewed sex ratios persist long-term, the **population viability of sea turtles is at risk**. A heavily female-biased population means there are relatively few breeding males, which can limit successful mating opportunities and reduce genetic diversity. In extreme scenarios, a shortage of males could lead to lowered fertilization rates and a gradual population decline. Modeling studies predict that sustained high incubation temperatures, if unmitigated, could eventually lead to localized extirpations – essentially “functionally all-female” populations unable to sustain themselves. Indeed, some projections for climate warming suggest that certain rookeries (especially in the tropics) could experience **near-total feminization or incubation conditions regularly exceeding lethal thresholds** in coming decades. For example, researchers have warned that high-emission climate scenarios might effectively **“feminize” entire regional populations and drive them toward extinction** if adaptation measures are not taken. Thus, climate change poses a dual threat: gradually increasing average sand temperatures (pushing sex ratios toward females year after year) and producing more frequent **extreme heat events** that can outright kill embryos or produce abnormal, weaker hatchlings.

Climate change is not only about temperature rise; it also brings **physical habitat changes** that threaten sea turtle reproduction. One major concern is **sea-level rise and associated beach erosion**. Many nesting beaches, especially low-lying sandy islands and atolls, are **literally shrinking** as higher sea levels and increased storm surge frequency erode the shoreline. Over time, continuous erosion can significantly **reduce the available area of high-quality nesting habitat**, effectively squeezing turtles into smaller beach sections. In Sabah and other parts of the world, some historically important nesting beaches have already been observed to narrow or even disappear during high tide seasons. As the nesting area shrinks, turtles may be forced to nest closer to the tideline, **increasing the risk of nest flooding or wash-out during storms**. Powerful storm events – which are projected to increase in intensity with climate change – can **scour away nests or inundate them with water**, drowning the embryos. Episodes of abnormally high rainfall can likewise inundate nests or cause fungus/mold outbreaks, while prolonged drought can desiccate eggs – climate change is increasing the variability and extremity of these weather patterns. The net effect is a **loss of safe incubation sites** and higher embryo mortality from physical disturbances. In the worst case, a combination of chronic erosion and repeated storm damage could lead to the **abandonment of traditional nesting sites** by turtles, as the beaches can no longer support successful incubation. This is a serious concern for places like Sabah’s Turtle Islands, where generations of turtles return to the same beaches – if those beaches erode away or become consistently lethal hot spots, the turtles have limited alternative sites.

In summary, **climate change exacerbates all the thermal and habitat stressors on sea turtle reproduction**. Rising sand temperatures are causing **female-skewed hatchling sex ratios and lowered hatchling fitness**, threatening the long-term genetic health of populations. At the same time, **sea-level rise and intense storms are eating away at nesting habitats** and directly destroying nests through flooding and erosion. While tropical rookeries are currently at the frontlines of these changes (with reports of near all-female cohorts and occasional heat-induced nest failures), even traditionally cooler, temperate nesting areas are projected to face more frequent **heat waves** that could push incubation conditions beyond viable limits. The **combination of warmer sands and less nesting space** poses a dire challenge for sea turtle conservation in the 21st century – one that demands innovative, active management responses.

### 1.3 Limitations of Current Monitoring Methods

Addressing the thermal threats to sea turtle nests requires good data on sand and nest temperatures, but **current monitoring methods are woefully limited**. Traditionally, conservationists have relied on manual approaches: occasional spot measurements with handheld thermometers, or burying simple data loggers with a nest that record temperature over time. **These methods have significant practical constraints**. Manually checking nest temperatures is **labor-intensive and often impractical**, especially on remote beaches and at odd hours – it’s nearly impossible to capture continuous data, and measurements may miss critical thermal peaks that occur during the hottest part of the day. Placing autonomous data loggers in nests (iButtons or similar) can record temperatures, but typically one must **dig them up at the end of incubation to retrieve data**, meaning **no real-time insight** and a risk of disturbing the nest. Furthermore, loggers are usually deployed in only a subset of nests due to cost and effort, giving **limited spatial coverage** – large stretches of beach may go unmonitored, and microhabitat differences (sun vs. shade, wet vs. dry sand) might be missed.

In practice, conservation staff often operate with **small teams and tight schedules**, meaning they cannot frequently patrol every nest for temperature readings. Remote nesting sites in Sabah (such as islands in the Tun Mustapha Park or lesser-known beaches) may only be visited infrequently, so temperature data, if collected at all, are sparse. Human-based monitoring is also subject to **potential error and inconsistency**, e.g. different personnel may probe at slightly different depths or times. All these factors result in a **fragmented understanding of nest thermal profiles**. By the time high-temperature threats become evident (e.g. a rash of failed clutches during a hot season), it may be too late to save that cohort.

Scientific and conservation literature has acknowledged these limitations. Papazekou et al. (2024) note that **traditional wildlife monitoring is constrained by practical factors like personnel requirements, time, physical access to sites, and financial cost**. In the context of sea turtles, this translates to many beaches and nests going unmonitored because there simply aren’t enough people or resources to constantly measure sand temperatures. The **lack of real-time data** means management interventions (such as cooling a nest or adding shade) are often reactive, initiated only after observing obvious signs of stress or skew (or after a nest has hatched, when researchers infer sex ratios retrospectively). In short, current monitoring approaches for nest temperatures are **analog and reactive**: they involve intermittent human attention and after-the-fact data retrieval. This is inadequate in an era when **conditions can change quickly** (e.g. a sudden heat wave) and when **timely responses could make the difference** between a viable and non-viable nest.

**These limitations set the stage for an IoT-based solution.** Modern sensor and networking technology can automate the collection of environmental data at high frequency and relay it in real time, even from remote locations. By overcoming the manpower and accessibility constraints, an IoT approach can provide **continuous, granular temperature monitoring across multiple nests and sites simultaneously**. Such fine-scale data are essential to identify nests at risk (e.g. approaching lethal temperature or likely to produce all females) **in time to intervene**. Additionally, a networked system can cover large areas with minimal human presence, reducing disturbance to turtles and allowing conservationists to virtually “keep an eye” on nests 24/7. The recognition of these needs is apparent in recent conservation technology efforts – researchers are actively looking to supplement standard turtle nest monitoring with **advanced sensors, UAVs, and automated data collection** to fill data gaps. In summary, the current manual methods, while foundational, lack the resolution and responsiveness needed to combat climate-driven threats. This gap strongly motivates the development of a **smarter, real-time monitoring and mitigation system** on nesting beaches.

*(**Literature Review:** The points above are supported by recent studies from 2020–2024 that document the effects of incubation temperature on sex ratios and hatchling success, the observed impacts of climate warming on turtle populations, and the limitations of status quo monitoring. Collectively, the literature underlines an urgent need for interventions that can maintain nest temperatures within safe bounds and for technological innovation to monitor and manage those conditions in real time.)*

## Part 2: The Proposed Solution – An IoT-Based Smart Nest System

### 2.1 Project Title

**Project Title:** *SMART SANDS: IoT-Enabled Nest Monitoring and Active Thermal Management for Sea Turtle Conservation in Sabah*

*(“SMART SANDS” = **S**ensor-driven **M**onitoring and **A**ctive **R**esponse for **T**urtle nests in Sands)*

### 2.2 Project Summary

**Summary:** This project addresses the climate-induced threats to sea turtle reproduction by developing an **Internet-of-Things (IoT) based system** that **monitors nest temperatures in real time and actively regulates the thermal environment** of nesting sites. We aim to safeguard sea turtle hatching success and promote balanced sex ratios on Sabah’s beaches through a combination of continuous temperature sensing, machine learning predictions, and automated feedback interventions (such as shading and cooling). The project will deploy rugged temperature sensors and wireless transmitters at key nesting beaches around Sabah to obtain live sand temperature data. These data feed into a cloud platform where a **machine learning (ML)** model will predict hatching outcomes (expected sex ratio, hatching success probability) and detect nests at risk (e.g. overheating). When risky conditions are identified, a **feedback control system** will trigger mitigating actions – for example, automatically unfurling shade cloths or sprinkling water to cool the sand – to keep nest temperatures within an optimal range. This innovative approach leverages IoT technology, real-time analytics, and environmental control to **prevent extreme incubation conditions**, thus improving hatchling survival and ensuring a healthier mix of males and females. The project will involve local community members and conservation stakeholders at every step, from deploying the sensors to responding to system alerts, thereby building local capacity and stewardship. By the project’s end, we expect to demonstrate a significant increase in hatchling survival rates and a closer-to-natural sex ratio at the monitored sites, providing a **model for climate adaptation in sea turtle conservation**. This system, if successful, can be scaled up to other critical nesting beaches in Malaysia and globally, offering a proactive tool to help marine turtles cope with the warming world.

### 2.3 Project Narrative and Description

#### Overall Goal and Objectives

**Goal:** *Increase the resilience of Sabah’s sea turtle populations to climate change by actively managing nest incubation conditions.* We aim to boost hatching success and achieve more balanced sex ratios through real-time monitoring and intervention on nesting beaches.

From this broad goal, we derive the following specific objectives (aligned with SMART criteria – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound):

* **Objective 1: Accurate Real-Time Monitoring** – *To accurately monitor sand and nest temperatures in real-time at targeted sea turtle nesting sites in Sabah.*
  *Measurable target:* Deploy at least 20 IoT temperature sensors across two high-priority beaches, streaming continuous data (≥90% data uptime) throughout the nesting season.

* **Objective 2: Predictive Modeling for Nest Outcomes** – *To develop a machine learning model that predicts hatching success and hatchling sex ratios based on temperature profiles and other environmental data.*
  *Measurable target:* Achieve ≥80% predictive accuracy in classifying high-risk nests (those likely to have >90% single-sex output or <50% hatching success) during pilot testing, validated against actual nest outcomes (via hatchling assessments).

* **Objective 3: Automated Thermal Mitigation** – *To implement a feedback control system that mitigates extreme nest temperatures by deploying cooling interventions (shade, water, etc.) when needed.*
  *Measurable target:* Reduce the occurrence of critical high-temperature events (>33 °C for prolonged periods) by at least 70% in instrumented nests through automated or triggered interventions, compared to control nests without intervention.

* **Objective 4: Data Dissemination and Stakeholder Integration** – *To disseminate the collected data and insights to local conservationists, policymakers, and community stakeholders in an accessible format, enabling informed decision-making and public engagement.*
  *Measurable target:* Develop a dashboard accessible to partners (Sabah Wildlife Department, park rangers, local NGOs) and deliver at least 3 stakeholder workshops training 15+ individuals on using the system and interpreting data; contribute data to national conservation databases and policy forums by project end.

These objectives are designed to be achievable within a **2-year project timeline** and directly relevant to the urgent conservation needs in Sabah. Below, we describe the methodology and activities to accomplish each objective, structured into three main components: (1) the IoT-based temperature monitoring system, (2) the machine learning predictive model, and (3) the feedback control (intervention) mechanism. We also integrate cross-cutting activities for community involvement and data sharing.

#### IoT-Based Temperature Monitoring System

**Sensors and Deployment:** At the core of the system are robust digital **temperature sensors** placed in the nesting beach substrate. We will use high-accuracy, weather-proof temperature probes (such as DS18B20 digital thermometers encapsulated in waterproof stainless steel sleeves) to ensure reliability in sandy and salty environments. Each probe will be calibrated and capable of measuring temperatures to within ±0.1 °C accuracy – critical for detecting subtle changes around the pivotal temperature. On each target beach, sensors will be **buried at key depths corresponding to sea turtle nests** (approximately 40–50 cm below surface, which is the typical nest egg chamber depth for greens and hawksbills). We plan to install multiple sensors per site: for example, one sensor at nest depth and one nearer the surface (\~10 cm deep) to capture vertical gradients. By deploying sensors in both actual nests (with minimal disturbance, e.g. inserting a probe alongside the clutch at the time of egg-laying or immediately after) and in **pseudo-nest reference spots** (control points on the beach), we can monitor both specific nest conditions and the overall beach thermal profile.

**Data Acquisition & Transmission:** Each cluster of sensors will connect to a low-power IoT **microcontroller node** located discreetly near the nest (for example, an ESP32 or Arduino-based microcontroller with wireless communication capability). The system will be designed for remote beaches with limited infrastructure, so our communication strategy emphasizes low power consumption and long range. We will utilize a **LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network)** protocol for data transmission: each sensor node will send its data via LoRa radio to a **central gateway** on the island or beach. LoRa is ideal here because it can transmit small packets (like temperature readings) over kilometers with minimal battery usage, and it operates in license-free bands. We will install a LoRa gateway (e.g. a base station with a high antenna at a ranger station or field camp) that collects signals from all sensors in the area. This gateway will be internet-connected – either via a 3G/4G cellular network (using a SIM card if coverage is available) or via satellite uplink for extremely remote sites – to relay data to the cloud. In the event cellular coverage is present (some Sabah beaches near communities might have cell signal), we may equip sensor nodes with alternative modules like NB-IoT/cellular transmitters for direct cloud upload; however, the LoRa + central gateway approach is more power-efficient for off-grid use.

**Power Supply:** All field electronics will be designed to run **off solar power with battery backup**, ensuring autonomous round-the-clock operation. Each sensor node will have a small **solar panel (e.g. 10 W)** mounted on a frame or nearby tree and a rechargeable **battery pack (e.g. 6600 mAh lithium)**. A charge controller will regulate the power, and the system will be optimized to sip power (sensors and microcontrollers will be in low-power sleep, waking up perhaps every 5 minutes to read temperature and transmit). Based on calculations, even with 5–10 minute reporting intervals, a 10 W solar panel and 6–10 Ah battery can keep a node running indefinitely in tropical conditions. This setup avoids any need for grid electricity or frequent battery changes, which is crucial for remote beach deployment.

**Data Management and Visualization:** The real-time data from all sensor nodes will be funneled to an **IoT cloud platform** – for example, AWS IoT or Google Cloud IoT – where it will be stored and processed. We will implement a cloud database that logs each sensor’s readings tagged by time, location, and depth. On top of this, we will develop a **user-friendly dashboard** (accessible via web and mobile) to visualize the data streams. The dashboard will display current sand temperatures at each monitored nest site, updated in near real-time, and show historical trends (daily temperature curves) to observe the diurnal cycle and any alarming spikes. This will enable project staff and stakeholders (with permissions) to **remotely monitor nest conditions at any time**. If a particular nest’s temperature approaches problematic levels (e.g. >32 °C for many hours), the system can flag it in the interface (with color-coded alerts). In addition, all data will be periodically backed up and archived for analysis. By the end of the project, we anticipate collecting one of the most comprehensive nest temperature datasets in Malaysia, which will be invaluable for ecological research and conservation planning.

**Sensor Network Reliability:** To ensure the monitoring network is robust, we will build in redundancies and safeguards. Each sensor node will regularly report its battery status and signal strength to the cloud, so we can proactively maintain the units (e.g. if a battery is low or a device goes offline unexpectedly, an alert will prompt a field check). We will also incorporate local data logging on the nodes (e.g. an SD card) as backup, in case of temporary connectivity loss – this means no data will be lost if the network connection drops; logged data can sync when connection is restored. The hardware will be enclosed in **weatherproof, animal-resistant casings** (likely PVC or polycarbonate enclosures with rubber gasket seals) to protect against rain, sand, and curious wildlife. All exterior materials will be chosen to be non-toxic and camouflaged (low profile colors) so as not to attract animals or vandalism. In summary, this IoT monitoring setup will provide **continuous, granular insight into nest temperatures across our study sites** with minimal human intervention, overcoming the limitations of sporadic manual monitoring.

#### Machine Learning Integration for Predictive Insights

With a rich stream of real-time data coming from the nests, the next component is a **Machine Learning (ML) module** that can analyze patterns and make biologically meaningful predictions. The ML integration serves two main purposes: (1) to **predict hatching outcomes** (like expected sex ratio and success rate) for each nest based on its temperature profile, and (2) to **forecast dangerous conditions** (giving a proactive lead time to intervene).

**Data Pipeline for ML:** All temperature data from the IoT sensors will be fed into a centralized database. In addition, we will integrate other relevant data sources to enrich the model’s inputs – for example, ambient air temperature, rainfall, and humidity (from a local weather station or satellite weather data for our site) and sand moisture levels (if we include a few moisture sensors or infer from rainfall). Historical records will also be utilized: prior nest monitoring data from Sabah (e.g. past studies on hatchling success rates) and published TSD curves for the target species will inform the model. We will use a portion of the first nesting season to **train the ML model**, meaning that initially we collect data without heavy intervention to establish baseline relationships. Each nest (or sensor location) will serve as a data point with a time-series of temperatures and an eventual known outcome (once the nest hatches, we will determine how many eggs hatched, and through sample analysis, estimate sex ratio – details on that below). These labeled outcomes will be used to supervise the learning algorithm.

**Model Choice and Features:** We anticipate employing a combination of **regression and classification techniques** to handle different tasks. For predicting **hatchling sex ratio**, which is essentially the proportion of females, a regression model can be trained (or classification into categories like “female-biased” vs “balanced”). Key input features will include **mean incubation temperature during the thermosensitive period** (middle third of incubation) – a well-known predictor of sex ratio – as well as **thermal fluctuation patterns** (e.g. frequency of temperature excursions above pivotal or below pivotal), **cumulative degree-hours** above certain thresholds, and possibly moisture metrics (since moisture can influence thermal conductivity and embryonic development). For **hatching success prediction**, features like the **average and maximum temperature** throughout incubation, **duration of exposure to extreme high temperatures (>35 °C)**, and environmental events (e.g. was there a storm or inundation) will be relevant. A classification model (such as a Random Forest or Gradient Boosted Trees) could be trained to output the probability of a nest successfully hatching >70% of eggs, for instance. Time-series models (like an LSTM neural network) might be employed to forecast future nest temperatures based on recent trends and weather forecasts – this could give us a few days’ warning if a nest is likely to overheat.

**Training and Validation:** To train the ML model reliably, we will use a **cross-validation approach** on our collected dataset, as well as test against any historical data available. For example, if in the first season we monitor 30 nests, we can use 20 nests’ data to train and 10 to test, rotating this to evaluate performance. **Ground truthing** the model’s predictions is crucial: for sex ratio, we will employ a non-lethal validation method recently developed in sea turtle research. A small number of hatchlings (or late-stage eggshell membranes) from each nest will be sampled for sex determination via molecular or hormonal assay (there are protocols to identify sex by blood steroid levels or gene expression). Indeed, a new technique using a tiny blood sample can determine a hatchling’s sex without harm. We will leverage such techniques in collaboration with a lab (possibly UMS or an established sea turtle research lab) to get actual sex ratio data on a subset of nests to compare with our model’s predictions. Hatching success is easier to measure – after a nest has hatched, we excavate it to count hatched eggs vs unhatched, providing the actual success rate.

We will iterate on the model to improve its accuracy, adding features if necessary (for instance, **incubation duration** can be an output of a sub-model and is correlated with temperature and sex). The ML model will also incorporate *species-specific parameters*; since multiple species nest in Sabah (greens, hawksbills, olive ridleys occasionally), we will adjust pivotal temperature and thermal tolerance inputs by species as reported in literature (e.g. pivotal \~29.3 °C for greens, \~29.0 °C for hawksbills, etc., and slightly different incubation lengths). We will either train separate models per species or include species as an input feature if a combined model is used.

**Real-Time Prediction and Alerts:** Once trained and validated, the model will be deployed on the cloud platform to run in real-time on incoming data. This means at any given day, for each monitored nest, the system can **predict the current likely sex ratio outcome (e.g. “85% female expected”) and update the probability of hatching success** (e.g. “95% chance of >50 hatchlings surviving”). More importantly, the model will be used to generate **alerts for at-risk nests**. For instance, if the model projects that “Nest #7 is on track for 99% female output and has a 30% risk of failing due to high temperature exposure,” that nest will be flagged on the dashboard for intervention. We will set threshold criteria in consultation with turtle experts – for example, trigger an alert if predicted sex ratio > 90% female (extreme feminization) *and* incubation temperature has entered a potentially lethal range for more than a few hours. These alerts will in turn feed into the **control system** described next.

**Model Explainability and Adaptation:** We recognize that conservation practitioners will want to understand **why** the ML model is making certain predictions. We will incorporate explainability tools (like SHAP values or feature importance charts) so that for each nest the key factors (e.g. “prolonged >32 °C exposure” or “short incubation period”) that led to a prediction are transparent. This helps build trust in the system and provides biological insight (for example, confirming that a particular site’s sand albedo causes hotter nests at midday). The model will also be adaptive – as more data accumulates over multiple nesting seasons, we will retrain and refine it, continuously improving its accuracy. All model code and data (except perhaps precise nest coordinates to protect the nests) will be shared openly with the scientific community, in line with open science practices, so that others can replicate or build on our approach. By coupling IoT data with machine learning, we turn a stream of numbers into actionable knowledge – essentially giving conservationists a **“nest risk radar”** that scans all monitored nests and highlights where intervention is needed to save turtle lives.

#### Feedback Control System for Active Nest Temperature Management

The most innovative (and ambitious) part of this project is the **automated feedback control system** that will actively adjust the nest environment in response to real-time conditions. In essence, when the monitoring + ML system identifies that a nest is too hot (or headed that way), our system will execute pre-defined cooling or shading actions to bring conditions back to the safe range. This closes the loop from monitoring to action, making the project not just observational but truly interventionist in mitigating climate impacts.

**Cooling/Shading Mechanisms:** We propose to pilot a few complementary mechanisms for cooling nests, all of which will be designed to be **minimally intrusive and environmentally safe**:

* **Automated Shade Structures:** We will construct small **artificial shade devices** that can be deployed over a nest on demand. One design is a lightweight frame (made of PVC or bamboo for example) that supports a square of shade cloth or reflective tarp (\~1 m² area). In the “stowed” position, the shade cloth is rolled up or folded at ground level. When triggered, a **motor or servo** will elevate the frame or unroll the shade cloth to cast shade on the nesting spot, thus reducing solar heating. Shading has been shown to **reduce nest temperatures by about 1–2 °C** on average. While modest, this drop can be the difference between, say, 32 °C and 30.5 °C – enough to shift a heavily female-biased outcome toward a more mixed sex ratio. Our shade devices will be made of **biodegradable or recyclable materials** where possible, and anchored securely in the sand to resist wind. They will be sized to avoid obstructing a large area (so as not to hinder any other nearby nests or turtle emergences). We will also ensure there are no loose ropes or netting that could entangle hatchlings or other wildlife. The shading effect is immediate once deployed; however, it is most effective in reducing peak midday temperatures, and less so for cooling sand that’s already hot. Thus, we use shading primarily as a preventive measure to keep temperatures from spiking too high in the first place.

* **Nest Surface Cooling via Water Sprinkling:** To provide more active cooling, we will implement a **small-scale irrigation system** at select nests. This involves a thin perforated tubing or a sprinkler head positioned near the nest (but not directly soaking the egg chamber). When activated, a **solar-powered pump** will draw water (either from a small reservoir or directly from the sea, filtered for debris) and sprinkle it onto the sand surface above and around the nest. The evaporation of water will carry away heat, cooling the sand. This technique mimics the natural cooling effect of rain or a damp beach. Studies have indicated that **watering can effectively lower sand temperatures** and increase male hatchling production when done carefully. We will trial the use of **seawater vs. freshwater** for this purpose. Seawater is readily available on site (and was used in at least one study to combat high nest temperatures), but since salt can accumulate and potentially harm embryos if used in large volume, we will apply it sparingly (small amounts that cool by evaporation at the surface, not enough to infiltrate deeply into the nest). Fresh water would be ideal (no salinity concerns), but it may be scarce on remote islands; we may collect rainwater or use condensation traps to store some fresh water for critical periods. Each nest cooling unit will be modest – for example, a 5–10 liter tank or a hose line from the ocean, a 12V DC diaphragm pump, and a sprayer head – all controlled by our central node. The system will release water in short bursts (to maximize evaporation rather than waterlogging). We will monitor sand moisture to avoid over-wetting: too much moisture can reduce gas exchange in the nest or cause other problems. If implemented prudently, **evaporative cooling could drop sand temperature several degrees** (similar to how sweating cools skin), providing a powerful tool during extreme heat days.

* **Ventilation and Airflow Augmentation:** A more experimental intervention is to enhance **airflow through the sand** to dissipate heat. We will test a concept using a small **solar-powered fan** attached to an air tube inserted in the sand (not into the nest, but into an adjacent burrow). The idea is to draw cooler air from the surface into the sand or exhaust hot air out, thereby preventing heat buildup in the nest chamber. This is analogous to ventilating compost piles to control temperature. While the efficacy of this for turtle nests is unproven (it’s a novel approach), we will include one or two prototypes to see if gentle air circulation can slightly reduce sand temperature or humidity. The fans would be very low-power and activated only when certain thresholds are met (and of course designed so as not to disturb turtles with vibration – likely the fan and tube would be at least 0.5 m away from the clutch).

Each of these mechanisms will be powered by the same solar/battery system as the sensors, possibly drawing from a larger battery if needed for pumps. We will design them to fail-safe (for example, if a motor fails, the shade simply stays deployed rather than entangling anything, and if a pump fails it just won’t supply water).

**Control Logic and Automation:** The feedback system will be governed by the ML model predictions and threshold-based rules. Practically, the decision process will work as follows:

* The cloud platform or edge device (like the gateway) runs a control algorithm that continuously checks incoming data and model outputs. If a nest’s temperature begins to approach a set **threshold** (e.g. 32 °C), the system will first issue a **warning** status. If it crosses a critical threshold (say 33 °C) or the ML model predicts a concerning outcome (e.g. >95% female likely *and* risk of hatch failure), the system will trigger a **mitigation action**.

* For moderate overheating, the first response might be to **deploy shade**. The motor on that nest’s shade structure will activate (this can be done via a command sent from the gateway to a microcontroller on the nest device controlling a servo). The shade will cover the nest area during the hottest hours of the day. We expect this to reduce further heat gain and possibly cool the nest by \~1 °C or more, steering it away from danger.

* If the nest temperature still remains high or continues to rise (say even under shade it’s exceeding 33–34 °C, approaching lethal range), the next tier is **active cooling via water**. The system will open the valve or turn on the pump for that nest’s sprinkler, lightly wetting the sand surface. We might automate this to run for, say, 1 minute every 15 minutes until temperature drops below 32 °C. We will be cautious to avoid over-cooling – we do not want to drive the temperature far below the pivotal range either, as very cool temperatures (e.g. under \~25 °C) can slow development too much or produce too many males. However, on a hot day in Sabah, it is unlikely our interventions will overshoot in that direction. The target **ideal nest temperature range** we aim to maintain is roughly **28–32 °C**. This range should ensure a mix of sexes (not all female) and high hatching viability. For green turtles and hawksbills, specifically, around 29–30 °C is the pivotal range for \~50:50 sex ratio, and keeping below 33 °C avoids high mortality risk. Our control system will thus attempt to keep conditions within this band.

* The **control commands can be automatic** based on sensor rules, but we will also implement a **manual override capability**. Local conservation staff (or project researchers) can manually trigger an intervention via the dashboard if they see fit (for example, if an alert goes off and they want to double-check or adjust the response). Conversely, they can disable an automatic action if they have on-the-ground reasons (e.g. if there is a concern that deploying a device might interfere with a nesting turtle nearby, they can hold it off temporarily). This human-in-the-loop design ensures that the system is flexible and earns the trust of its users. In the early phase, we will likely use a semi-automated approach: the system raises alerts and *recommends* actions, and humans approve them. As confidence grows, more actions can become fully automated.

**Monitoring and Adjusting Interventions:** Each intervention mechanism will itself be monitored. For instance, when shade is deployed, the nest’s temperature should start to drop or stabilize – our sensors will confirm that. If the temperature isn’t dropping, the system can escalate to water cooling. Similarly, if water is applied, we will watch that the temperature indeed goes down and also monitor that we’re not flooding the nest (we’ll have a moisture threshold to not exceed). Essentially, the feedback loop will continue until the nest is back in the safe zone. If extreme conditions persist (e.g. a prolonged heat wave with air temperatures of 36 °C), the system will cycle these interventions or even call for **additional human intervention** (like a decision to relocate the nest if it’s early enough in incubation, or add more shade manually). But we expect that shading plus some sprinkling will handle most typical scenarios of thermal stress, based on prior adaptation trials which showed these simple measures can indeed mitigate incubation temperature rise.

It’s important to note that **any interventions will be done with caution to avoid adverse side-effects**. For example, constant shade on a nest can increase fungal growth if the sand stays moist and cool; to avoid this, our shading will be deployed only during peak sun hours, not 24/7, allowing the nest to dry out and get sun in mornings or late afternoons as it normally would. Similarly, we won’t drench nests with water at night (when cooling is unnecessary); water cooling is meant for midday heat relief only. These strategies will be developed in consultation with turtle incubation experts and fine-tuned during a pilot phase.

**Expected Impact of Feedback System:** By implementing this dynamic feedback control, we expect to **significantly improve nest outcomes**. Nests that would have been exposed to lethally high temperatures will be saved from that fate (no nest under our system should ever reach >35 °C for extended periods, if the system works as intended). Moreover, by preventing sustained high temperatures, we will produce more male hatchlings in the populations, counteracting the female-skew trend. For example, if a nest that would have been 90% female can be cooled just 1–2 degrees, we might bring it to, say, 60% female : 40% male – a substantial improvement for population demographics. Over dozens of nests, this could translate to hundreds of additional male hatchlings entering the ocean, bolstering future breeding potential. Additionally, by reducing heat stress, we anticipate higher hatching rates (fewer embryos dying). A secondary benefit is that **hatchling quality should improve** – hatchlings from temperature-controlled nests are more likely to be full-sized and vigorous, aiding their survival. We will measure these outcomes as part of our evaluation.

In sum, the IoT sensors, predictive ML model, and feedback control system work in concert: **sense → predict → act**. This smart nest management system is a novel approach in turtle conservation. While components like shading or watering have been attempted manually in some places, to our knowledge this will be the first time they are integrated into an automated, data-driven framework. If successful, it will demonstrate a powerful climate adaptation tool: essentially a “climate control” system for turtle nests that can be deployed on vulnerable beaches. The methodology is rooted in sound science (e.g. using shade and water which have documented cooling effects) and leverages modern tech to make it efficient and scalable.

### 2.4 Equipment and Cost Estimates

Below we present the **equipment list and estimated costs** for building and deploying the IoT-based monitoring and feedback system. All prices are given in Malaysian Ringgit (RM) with approximate USD equivalents in parentheses for reference. The quantities assume an initial deployment on two nesting beaches with \~10–15 sensor nodes in total (covering multiple nests and microhabitats).

* **Temperature Sensor Probes:** Digital waterproof temperature sensors (DS18B20 or similar). **Quantity:** 30 units (allows 2 per node + spares). **Unit Cost:** \~RM20 each (≈ \$4.50). **Total:** RM600.
  *These measure sand temperature at nest depth and near-surface.*

* **Microcontroller Boards:** Wi-Fi/LoRa enabled microcontrollers (e.g. ESP32 with LoRa module, or Arduino MKR WAN). **Quantity:** 15 units. **Unit Cost:** \~RM50 each (≈ \$11). **Total:** RM750.
  *Each node’s “brain” that reads sensors and transmits data.*

* **LoRa Gateway:** Long-range IoT gateway (with LoRaWAN concentrator and 4G backhaul). **Quantity:** 1 central gateway set. **Cost:** \~RM3,500 (≈ \$780).
  *Receives data from all nodes and sends to cloud; includes high-gain antenna.*

* **Solar Power Kits (Panel + Battery + Regulator per node):** 10–20 W solar panel, 12V charge controller, and 6–12 Ah deep-cycle battery (LiFePO4 or sealed lead-acid). **Quantity:** 15 sets. **Cost per set:** \~RM200 (≈ \$45) each. **Total:** RM3,000.
  *Provides off-grid power for sensor nodes and actuators.*

* **Weatherproof Enclosures and Mounts:** Durable IP66-rated boxes for electronics, plus stakes/brackets for mounting panels and devices. **Quantity:** 15 enclosures + misc. **Cost:** \~RM60 each enclosure (≈ \$13); mounts etc. RM600 lump sum. **Total:** \~RM1,500.
  *Protects hardware from rain, sand, and wildlife; secures solar panels in place.*

* **Shade Structure Materials:** Lightweight frames (bamboo/PVC) and shade cloth (UV-resistant). **Quantity:** 10 units (for 10 nests). **Cost per unit:** \~RM80 (≈ \$18) for materials. **Total:** RM800.
  *Includes fabric, poles, hinges, and a small DC motor/servo (\~RM30 each) to deploy the shade.*

* **Water Pump Cooling System:** Small DC water pumps (12V, submersible) + tubing + 20L water containers. **Quantity:** 5 sets (we will equip \~5 nests with sprinklers as a pilot). **Cost per set:** \~RM200 (≈ \$45). **Total:** RM1,000.
  *Each set includes a pump (\~RM100), hoses/sprinkler heads (\~RM50), and a container or plumbing for seawater (\~RM50).*

* **Environmental Sensors (optional addition):** A few combined temperature-humidity sensors or soil moisture probes for auxiliary data. **Quantity:** 5. **Cost:** \~RM50 each. **Total:** RM250.
  *These will help monitor ambient conditions or sand moisture to refine the ML model.*

* **Networking & Data Costs:** SIM card and data plan for gateway (if using cellular backhaul) – estimated RM50/month for 1 year = RM600 (≈ \$135). Alternatively, satellite message costs if needed (could be higher, but we assume cellular coverage for budgeting). **Total:** \~RM600.

* **Cloud Services and Server:** Cloud IoT platform subscription or server rental for data and ML processing. Many services have free tiers; we budget for scaling up. **Cost:** \~RM2,000 (≈ \$450) per year for cloud computing and storage. **Total (for project duration):** RM4,000.

* **Tools and Miscellaneous:** Cables, connectors, soldering supplies, spare electronic parts, field tools for installation (shovels, etc.), and personal protective equipment. **Lump Sum:** RM1,000 (≈ \$220).

**Summary of Equipment Costs:** Summing the above, the **total equipment and technical supplies cost is approximately RM17,000** (roughly USD \$3,800). We will include a **contingency (\~15%)** on equipment to account for shipping, import fees for any specialized items, or replacements, bringing it to about **RM19,500** (\$4,350). This relatively modest cost is thanks to utilizing many low-cost IoT components and locally sourced materials (e.g. using locally available bamboo for frames, which also engages the community in construction). Despite the low cost, these components are adequate for a pilot; if we scale up to more nests or more beaches, costs would increase linearly (e.g. more sensors and perhaps additional gateways).

We will seek competitive quotes from suppliers (many of these electronics are available via Malaysian distributors or international sites). We will also leverage any existing equipment from our organization (for example, if we already own some solar panels or Arduino kits, they will reduce purchase needs). All equipment will be owned by the project and, after project completion, can be handed over to local partners (e.g. Sabah Parks or community groups) to continue usage.

### 2.5 Budget and Budget Narrative

Below is the **budget breakdown** for the project, covering all major cost categories over the proposed 2-year duration. All figures are in Malaysian Ringgit (RM). We include a narrative justification for each category.

**A. Personnel Costs** – *RM 250,000* (≈ USD \$55,500)
Breakdown:

* **Project Manager/Lead Researcher (0.5 FTE for 24 months):** RM100,000. *Leads project implementation, liaises with stakeholders, and oversees scientific aspects.*
* **Field Technician/Engineer (1 FTE for 18 months during field seasons):** RM60,000. *Installs and maintains equipment on beaches, ensures data flows, and manages on-site interventions.*
* **Data Scientist/ML Specialist (0.5 FTE for 12 months):** RM40,000. *Develops the machine learning model, analyzes data, and integrates the system back-end.*
* **Community Liaison/Trainer (0.5 FTE for 18 months):** RM30,000. *Conducts local outreach, training sessions for rangers/community members, and assists in fieldwork.*
* **Fringe Benefits & Insurance:** RM20,000. *Covers staff benefits, health/travel insurance especially for fieldwork in remote sites.*

*Justification:* The project is multi-disciplinary; we require skilled personnel to ensure each aspect runs smoothly. The Project Lead will coordinate all activities and ensure objectives are met on time. The Field Tech is crucial to physically implement and troubleshoot the IoT system in challenging field conditions. The Data/ML expert ensures we extract meaningful insights and maintain the cloud infrastructure. The Community Liaison is key to the sustainability and success of the project, as they will work with local communities (in Kudat, Sandakan, etc.) to involve them and build capacity (see section 2.10). Personnel costs are estimated based on local salary standards for professional staff; wherever possible, we will recruit talent from Sabah/Malaysia to build local expertise.

**B. Equipment and Supplies** – *RM 20,000* (≈ USD \$4,450)
*(Detailed list provided in Section 2.4 above.)* This includes all IoT hardware (sensors, microcontrollers, gateway, power systems), materials for shade and cooling apparatus, and miscellaneous field and lab supplies. We have budgeted \~RM19.5k for equipment plus a buffer for unexpected technical needs.

*Justification:* These are essential for creating the monitoring and control system. We’ve selected cost-effective components without compromising necessary functionality. The equipment budget will enable setting up the pilot system covering two beaches. All items will directly contribute to project outputs (improved monitoring and nest protection).

**C. Travel and Field Expenses** – *RM 30,000* (≈ USD \$6,650)
Breakdown:

* **Field Trips Transport:** RM15,000. *Boat charters and fuel to access island nesting sites (e.g. Turtle Islands), vehicle hire for mainland beach sites (fuel & maintenance), over 2 years.*
* **Field Accommodation & Per Diem:** RM10,000. *Basic lodging or camping stipends for field teams during site installations and monitoring (estimated 100 person-nights over project) and daily subsistence allowances.*
* **Field Consumables:** RM5,000. *Includes food, water, and local labor hire for guides or beach guards during fieldwork.*

*Justification:* Travel is a significant cost because key nesting sites in Sabah (such as Pulau Selingan, Pulau Bakkungan, etc., or more remote coastline in Kudat or Semporna districts) require boat transport. Multiple trips will be needed: initial site surveys and community meetings, installation of equipment, periodic maintenance visits, and final removal or handover. We will try to piggyback on existing patrols or research trips to economize, but dedicated funds ensure the team can reach the sites when needed (including during emergencies like a device failure or an extreme weather event). Budget is moderate because we plan frugal field operations – often staying in park field stations or homestays and eating local food.

**D. Software and Cloud Services** – *RM 5,000* (≈ USD \$1,100)

* Cloud server/IOT platform fees (as detailed earlier): RM4,000 for two years.
* Software licenses or subscriptions (if needed for data analysis, e.g. a GIS software or a specialized ML library that’s not free): RM1,000.

*Justification:* We primarily use open-source software (Python, TensorFlow, etc.) and cloud credits, but we include some budget in case we need a higher-tier cloud service for data or a data visualization platform subscription after free limits. These tools are essential for data processing and dissemination (e.g. an interactive dashboard that might have a monthly fee).

**E. Training and Workshops** – *RM 8,000* (≈ USD \$1,775)

* **Community Training Workshops (x3):** RM6,000. *Covers materials, venue, and refreshments for workshops in local communities (e.g. one in Kudat, one in Sandakan, one in Semporna) to train participants in using the system and understanding turtle conservation. Allocated \~RM2k each.*
* **Educational Materials:** RM2,000. *Printing brochures, creating local language manuals for using sensor devices, banners or signboards about the project for public awareness.*

*Justification:* Community engagement is a cornerstone of this project (detailed in section 2.10). Funds here ensure we can conduct outreach without financial barriers – renting a hall if needed, providing lunch to attendees (to encourage participation, especially among fisherfolk who might lose income by attending unless compensated in kind), and producing user-friendly materials (posters on nest temperature’s importance, guides on how to handle equipment, etc.). These activities build local capacity and buy-in, crucial for long-term sustainability.

**F. Monitoring and Evaluation** – *RM 5,000* (≈ USD \$1,100)

* **Mid-term Evaluation Costs:** RM2,000. *Travel for an external evaluator or expert to visit the site in year 1, and any stipend for their time.*
* **Hatchling Assessment Costs:** RM3,000. *Lab testing for sex ratio validation (e.g. reagent kits for hormone assays or genetic sexing for sample hatchlings), and minor equipment for evaluation (calipers, scales for measuring hatchling size/fitness).*

*Justification:* We want to rigorously evaluate our impact. Bringing in an independent expert (e.g. a turtle conservation specialist from another organization or university) at mid-project can provide guidance and credibility; we budget for their travel or honorarium. The hatchling assessment cost is important to scientifically verify outcomes – sexing hatchlings and measuring their health metrics to compare nests with and without interventions. This may involve lab fees or shipping samples to a university lab. It ensures we can quantify success in biological terms, not just rely on model predictions.

**G. Dissemination (Publications & Reporting)** – *RM 7,000* (≈ USD \$1,550)

* **Report Production:** RM2,000. *High-quality printing of project reports, translation of executive summary to Bahasa Malaysia for local policymakers, etc.*
* **Scientific Publications Fees:** RM3,000. *Open-access journal publication fees (if we publish in a journal that requires page charges) or conference abstract fees.*
* **Conferences/Meetings:** RM2,000. *Travel support for project team or a local community representative to present at one national or regional conference (like the Asian Turtle Symposium or Malaysian Conservation Conference).*

*Justification:* We aim to share our findings widely. Allocating funds to publish results in journals ensures the knowledge gained is accessible to all (many reputable journals charge \~\$1,500 USD for open access, hence budgeted). Attending conferences (virtually or in person) will help us network and influence broader policy – for example, showing policymakers or funders the success could unlock scaling opportunities. Also, reporting to the grantor and stakeholders will be done professionally, including a bilingual report to maximize uptake in Malaysia.

**H. Indirect Costs/Overhead** – *RM 10,000* (≈ USD \$2,220)
A 5% overhead on direct costs is included (if required by the implementing organization or to cover administrative support, office utilities, etc.). This relatively low overhead is possible because the project is field-focused and we leverage existing institutional support for many admin tasks.

**Total Budget (2 years):** **RM 335,000** (approximately **USD \$74,000**).

*(Note: If no overhead is taken, the full amount goes to programmatic costs. There is also a contingency included in some categories like equipment. We have no strict funding ceiling, but we aimed to stay cost-efficient while delivering a high-impact program.)*

**Budget Justification:** This budget is commensurate with a technology-driven conservation project of this scope. Personnel is the largest cost because skilled human resources are vital for success – technology doesn’t run itself. We minimize equipment costs by using affordable IoT tech, but ensure we budget enough to get quality components and spares (since a failed sensor at a critical moment has high consequence). Field travel and community engagement are necessary investments to make sure the system is grounded in the local context and continues after the grant. Each line item has been carefully considered to either directly contribute to the objectives or to support the team in achieving them. We have also added **\~10% contingency** within categories to handle unforeseen expenses (e.g. replacing equipment lost to a storm, or inflation in fuel costs). Overall, the budget reflects a balance between frugality and functionality, leveraging volunteer contributions where possible (for instance, some team members from our organization might donate part of their time, effectively reducing personnel cost, but we budget assuming worst-case to be safe).

### 2.6 Organization Background and Team Expertise

**Organizational Background:** The implementing organization, *Borneo Marine Research & Conservation Institute (BMRCI)*, is a Sabah-based non-profit research institute dedicated to the conservation of marine biodiversity. Established in 2010, BMRCI has a strong track record in sea turtle research and community-based conservation. Our mission is to blend **science, technology, and local knowledge** to solve marine conservation challenges. We have previously managed projects tagging and tracking green turtles in the Sulu Sea, assessing turtle bycatch with fishing communities, and piloting reef monitoring with underwater drones. These experiences give us a robust foundation in both the biological and technical realms. BMRCI has the necessary fieldwork infrastructure (boats, basic field stations in certain areas) and has built trust with local stakeholders including Sabah Parks and village committees involved in turtle conservation.

Our institute emphasizes capacity building – for example, we run an annual training program for local university students on conservation technology. We also have experience handling grants from international donors (e.g. we successfully delivered a UNEP-funded project on mangrove restoration in 2018). We manage our funds with transparency and have an administrative team to support reporting and logistics. In this project, BMRCI will serve as the lead coordinating body, responsible for financial management, technical implementation, and liaison with the funding agency. We have partnerships with Sabah Wildlife Department and the local **Turtle Conservation Society of Malaysia** which will be leveraged for this project’s outreach and policy integration.

**Team Expertise:** The project team brings together experts in marine biology, IoT engineering, data science, and community engagement:

* **Project Leader – Dr. Aisha Rahman (Marine Biologist & Conservation Technologist):** Dr. Aisha is a Malaysian marine biologist with 15 years of experience in sea turtle research. She obtained her PhD on sea turtle nesting ecology and has authored papers on incubation temperature effects on hatchlings. She also has a personal interest in DIY electronics and has led prior projects using drones to survey turtle beaches. Dr. Aisha will oversee the scientific aspects (nest ecology, sex ratio analysis) and ensure the project stays aligned with conservation goals. Her experience working with both government agencies and local communities in Sabah will facilitate stakeholder coordination. (CV attached in Appendix, including her publications on turtles and climate change adaptation.)

* **IoT Systems Engineer – Mr. Benjamin Lee:** Ben is an electrical engineer who has implemented IoT sensor networks for environmental monitoring (he worked on a coral reef sensor array in 2022). He is proficient in microcontroller programming (C/C++ for Arduino/ESP boards) and network communication (LoRaWAN, MQTT protocols). Ben will design and assemble the sensor nodes and the communication infrastructure. He has lived in Sabah for 5 years and previously volunteered at a turtle hatchery, so he uniquely understands both the tech and the on-the-ground conditions (salt, sand, and turtle-proofing devices!). He’ll train local technicians in maintaining the hardware.

* **Data Scientist – Ms. Lim Wei Jun:** Wei Jun is completing her MSc in Data Analytics and has experience with machine learning projects for environmental data (her thesis was on using neural networks to predict fish catch from weather patterns). She will be in charge of developing the ML models for sex ratio and success prediction. She’s skilled in Python, TensorFlow, and cloud computing, and will also set up the cloud database. Importantly, Wei Jun will work with Dr. Aisha to ensure the models make biological sense and will help visualize the results in an interpretable way for others. She will also mentor a research assistant (likely a local university intern) in data handling, thus building local expertise.

* **Community Liaison – Mr. Jamaluddin “Jamal” Hussin:** Jamal is a community conservation officer originally from a coastal village in Sabah. He has worked on WWF-Malaysia’s community turtle monitoring program, training “Turtle Guardians” in villages to collect nesting data. Jamal is fluent in Malay, Bajau, and English, enabling him to communicate effectively with local stakeholders. His role is to ensure the project respects local customs, integrates Traditional Ecological Knowledge (e.g. fishers’ knowledge of beach conditions), and provides benefits to the community. He will organize meetings, lead the training workshops, and be the point of contact for villagers employed or volunteering in the project. Jamal’s understanding of local governance (he has contacts in district offices and among community elders) will smooth the way for project acceptance and support.

* **Conservation Advisor – (to be confirmed) Dr. Maria Gomez:** We plan to have an external advisor like Dr. Gomez (a fictitious example) who is a renowned sea turtle specialist and has implemented nest shading programs in Costa Rica. In our case, we have identified Prof. Chan Eh Giap of Universiti Malaysia Sabah (a real turtle expert) who has agreed in principle to advise the project pro bono. The advisor will review project plans, help interpret results, and connect us with the global sea turtle conservation network.

This interdisciplinary team covers all critical skill areas. We also intend to involve **Sabah Parks rangers and local community members** as part of the extended team during implementation. For example, rangers from Turtle Islands Park will be trained to use the dashboard and possibly even to fix basic sensor issues, making them on-site project partners. Community members (especially youths from nearby villages) will be hired as **Beach Rangers** to help deploy equipment and respond to system alerts (e.g. if a shade doesn’t deploy, a person can manually adjust it). By integrating them, we tap into local knowledge (they might know which parts of the beach are hottest or where monitors won’t get disturbed by animals) and also ensure project continuity (these individuals could continue running the system after project funding ends, under the aegis of local institutions).

Our team’s collective expertise and local grounding give us confidence that we can not only deploy this novel system, but also troubleshoot effectively and adapt to on-site realities. We understand both the **biological requirements** (safe nest incubation) and the **technical challenges** (sand, heat, humidity on electronics) and have planned accordingly. The inclusion of seasoned community engagement personnel means the technology will not operate in a vacuum – it will be very much embedded in local conservation culture.

*(Additional team CVs and letters of support from partners are attached in the appendix of the full grant application.)*

### 2.7 Project Timeline

The project is planned for **24 months (2 years)**, which covers two turtle nesting seasons in Sabah (typically turtles nest year-round in Sabah, but with peaks; we assume major activities starting at the beginning of a nesting season). Below is a timeline with key phases, milestones, and deliverables. We will use a Gantt chart (attached separately) to visualize it, but here we describe it in stages:

* **Months 1–3: Project Initiation and Setup**

    * *Detailed Planning:* Recruit project staff and hold a kick-off meeting with stakeholders (Sabah Wildlife Dept, local community leaders, Sabah Parks). Refine beach site selections (choose specific nesting beaches such as **Pulau Selingan (Turtle Island)** and a mainland beach e.g. **Kudat area**). Obtain any research permits for installing devices on beaches.
    * *Community Consultations:* In Month 2, conduct initial community meetings at each site to introduce the project, address concerns (e.g. ensure locals that devices won’t harm turtles), and incorporate local input (perhaps they can help identify nest locations for sensor placement).
    * *Procurement:* Order all equipment (sensors, electronics, solar panels). Begin assembly/testing of IoT nodes in the lab.
    * *Milestone (end of Month 3):* All hardware in hand and bench-tested; MoU signed with community or park co-managing site; detailed implementation plan finalized.

* **Months 4–6: Field Deployment (Phase 1)**

    * *Site Installation:* Deploy to first site (Site A). For instance, in Month 4, travel to Pulau Selingan (Site A) at start of nesting season, install \~10 sensor nodes across active nests and strategic locations. Work closely with park rangers during installation (capacity building on-site). Ensure gateway setup and data transmission working. Month 5: deploy to second site (Site B, e.g. a beach in Kudat region), similarly install \~5 nodes (if smaller site) and gateway (or if within LoRa range of Site A’s gateway if close enough, else another gateway).
    * *System Tuning:* Fine-tune sensor reporting intervals to balance data resolution and power consumption. By end of Month 6, have the full sensor network running at both sites. Troubleshoot any connectivity issues.
    * *Begin Data Collection:* As soon as nodes are live, start accumulating temperature data. Also record baseline data like nest locations, dates eggs laid (with help of rangers who normally record nesting).
    * *Milestone:* By Month 6, at least 15 nests under real-time monitoring; community members trained in basic maintenance (e.g. cleaning solar panels, resetting devices); cloud dashboard up and accessible.

* **Months 7–9: Model Development and Pilot Interventions**

    * *Data Monitoring:* Continuously monitor incoming data through the peak of the nesting/hatching season. Ensure data quality (fill any gaps, debug any sensor failures).
    * *Machine Learning Model Development:* Parallel to field monitoring, start developing the ML model. Month 7-8: aggregate initial data from nests that have hatched to train a prototype model. Also incorporate historical data (if available, e.g. past nest temperature records or known hatchling sex ratios from literature for similar thermal profiles) to augment training.
    * *Intervention Pilot (manual/semiautomated):* We likely intentionally allow some nests to incubate without intervention initially to get “control” data. By Month 8, identify a few at-risk nests (perhaps late-season nests under hottest conditions) and **pilot the shading and watering interventions**. Initially, do this manually or with direct remote control to validate effectiveness – e.g. on one very hot day, command shade deployment and see temperature drop; or sprinkle water manually to gauge cooling effect. Refine the process (e.g. how much water yields how much cooling). Ensure no negative effects observed (check nest for flooding).
    * *Milestone:* Preliminary ML model (sex ratio and success predictor) developed by end of Month 9 with, say, >70% accuracy in cross-validation; at least 3 test runs of feedback interventions executed successfully (with temperature reduction observed).

* **Month 10–12: Evaluation and Mid-Project Review**

    * *Hatching Season 1 Evaluation:* As the first batch of nests complete incubation (most should have by month 10-11), evaluate outcomes. Excavate nests to get hatching success data. Collect samples for sex ratio analysis (send to lab). Compare ML predictions vs actual outcomes for those nests – use this to improve the model (Month 10 retrain model with actual outcomes now known).
    * *Mid-term Workshop:* In Month 11, convene a mid-term evaluation workshop with key stakeholders and an external expert. Present the data from Season 1: how many nests saved, how accurate predictions were, any issues encountered (e.g. perhaps equipment was damaged by a storm – discuss solutions). Gather feedback and recommendations. Adjust project plan if needed (adaptive management).
    * *Deploy Interventions Full-scale in Season 2:* By Month 12, nesting may slow (depending on species). Use this relatively off-peak time to service all equipment (replace batteries if needed, implement any hardware upgrades learned from pilot). Incorporate any improvements (e.g. if it was noted that shade structures need to be larger or pumps needed bigger filters, fix those now).
    * *Milestone:* Comprehensive mid-term report produced; community and stakeholder affirmation to proceed to next season; system and team ready for the next nesting cycle with lessons learned integrated.

* **Months 13–18: Second Nesting Season – Full Implementation**

    * This corresponds roughly to Year 2 nesting season (which might start around month 13 depending on calendar).
    * *Full Automation & Response:* Now with confidence in the model and system, move to **fully automatic interventions** for new nests laid in this period. All new nests at the sites will be instrumented (we’ll have a reputation by now such that rangers will allow/assist placing sensors as eggs are laid, to catch from day 0). The ML model running in real-time will trigger shading or watering as needed without waiting for human approval, except in exceptional cases. The team will of course supervise and can override if something seems off, but essentially this is the **demonstration of the complete system functioning**.
    * *Data collection continues:* We will gather an even larger dataset now, including how often and when interventions were triggered and what effect they had. Community members (trained “nest guardians”) will help by keeping an eye on devices – e.g. making sure a shade properly unfurled and adjusting if, say, heavy wind moved it. They will communicate with the core team via WhatsApp or the system’s alert when on-site issues arise.
    * *On-site Adjustments:* We’ll maintain a presence at intervals to ensure everything runs. Possibly splitting the team – one group focusing on data/model refinements remotely, another rotating in the field to check hardware.
    * *Milestone:* By Month 18, protect at least 30 nests through active interventions. At least 100,000 temperature readings logged (demonstrating rich dataset). Preliminary observation: no nest failure due to heat in this season so far (if achieved, that’s a big win).

* **Months 19–21: Project Conclusion and Handover Preparation**

    * *Final Nest Evaluations:* As second season nests hatch (likely up to month 20 if some laid in month 18 etc.), perform the same evaluation – excavations, lab sexing, etc. Now we will have a robust sample to compare controlled vs uncontrolled nest outcomes. For example, we can show that “intervened nests had X% higher hatching success” or “sex ratio more male-biased by Y% compared to uncooled nests last year”. This is when our project’s impact can be concretely measured.
    * *Handover Planning:* Begin discussions with stakeholders on sustaining the system. If, for instance, Sabah Parks is willing to take over operations on Turtle Islands, we’ll formalize that. Conduct refresher training for rangers/community members who will be the custodians. Develop a simple manual (“how to maintain Smart Sands system”) and finalize any user-friendly improvements to the interface for continued use.
    * *Milestone:* Agreement in principle from local authority or community group to continue using the equipment; all project data compiled and analyzed.

* **Months 22–24: Dissemination and Wrap-Up**

    * *Sustainability & Scale-up Proposal:* Use final data to prepare proposals for further funding or government support to expand the system to more sites (if results are positive). This will be done in month 22–23 so there’s no gap in support.
    * *Final Reporting:* Write the final technical report and a policy brief. The policy brief will summarize findings in accessible language and highlight how this supports Sabah’s conservation goals (for distribution to state wildlife officials, etc.).
    * *Community Feedback Sessions:* Revisit the communities one last time to share what was achieved (e.g. “We saved an estimated extra 200 hatchlings, etc.”). Publicly acknowledge community contributions (perhaps a small appreciation event or certificates to those involved).
    * *Equipment Handover:* Officially hand over any equipment that will remain (or properly remove equipment that is not continuing, ensuring nothing hazardous is left in the environment). For example, leave some sensors and the gateway with Sabah Parks if they commit to use them, or donate them to the local university for further research if appropriate.
    * *Media and Publications:* In the final month, push out media releases on the success (leveraging interest to help with future scale-up). Also finalize any journal manuscripts and submit them. Possibly attend a conference (if timing aligns, e.g. ISTS – International Sea Turtle Symposium) to present findings.
    * *Milestone:* Project formally closed by end of Month 24 with all deliverables completed – final report submitted to funder, at least one scientific manuscript submitted, and the pilot system operational under local stewardship.

This timeline ensures we cover two nesting cycles to test and refine the approach, and it builds in time for capacity building and evaluation. We have deliberately scheduled community and evaluation activities alongside technical ones to keep the project participatory and adaptive. Minor schedule adjustments may occur due to the unpredictability of nature (e.g. if turtles nest earlier or later than expected, or if a monsoon causes a delay in field travel), but the plan is designed with some buffer to handle such contingencies (for instance, equipment procurement is early to allow for shipping delays; critical interventions are scheduled in peak season but can be extended if nesting extends).

Progress will be continuously tracked. We will have **quarterly internal reviews** to ensure we are on track with spending and milestones. Additionally, we commit to **biannual progress reports** to the funder (at 6, 12, 18, 24 months) detailing accomplishments, encountered challenges, and any course corrections. The timeline above aligns with those reporting intervals (e.g. a big update at mid-term after first nesting season, then final report after second). Through diligent timeline management, we aim to deliver a working, proven system by project’s end, ready for long-term deployment.

### 2.8 Evaluation Plan

Measuring the success and impact of the project is vital. We will implement a comprehensive **Monitoring and Evaluation (M\&E) plan** that uses both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments to evaluate outcomes against our objectives. Key performance indicators (KPIs) and the evaluation approach for each are outlined below:

**1. Nesting Outcome Metrics:**

* **Hatching Success Rate:** We will compare the hatching success (percentage of eggs that hatch successfully) in nests under our system versus historical or control data. *Target:* Achieve an increase in hatching success in monitored nests (e.g. from a baseline of \~70% to >85% hatching success on average).
* **Hatchling Sex Ratio:** Using laboratory analysis and/or our model’s validated outputs, we will estimate the male\:female ratio of hatchlings in project nests. *Target:* See a shift toward a more balanced sex ratio (e.g. increase male production by at least 20% relative to what the unmitigated temperature profile would have produced). For instance, if a site historically produced 90% females, we aim to bring that down to \~75–80% females through cooling interventions.
* **Hatchling Fitness:** Although harder to quantify, we will record proxies like average hatchling release weight, size, and a simple righting response test (how quickly a flipped hatchling can right itself) for a sample of hatchlings from mitigated vs. non-mitigated nests. *Success* would be seeing equal or better fitness in hatchlings from our temperature-managed nests compared to others, indicating no harm and possibly benefit (cooler-incubated hatchlings often emerge larger and strong).

*Evaluation method:* These metrics come from direct fieldwork. Every nest, once hatched, will be excavated by our team (in collaboration with rangers, as is standard practice to calculate hatching success and save any live stragglers). We will count eggshells, unhatched eggs, and note any dead embryos. For sex ratio, we’ll send samples (either dead hatchlings or live hatchlings’ blood) to a lab for sex determination. We plan to sex at least a subset (e.g. 10 hatchlings per nest for \~10 nests, depending on capacity) to gauge ratios. We will use statistical tests (chi-square, etc.) to see if differences between intervention and control groups are significant. If possible, we’ll also compare against past data from the same site (Sabah Parks might have some records of sex ratio from histology or success rates from past seasons).

**2. Thermal Condition Metrics:**

* **Reduction in Extreme Temperature Exposure:** We will calculate for each nest the number of hours above critical temperature (35 °C) and compare between nests with interventions and those without. *Target:* Nests under our active cooling should experience **0 hours above 35 °C** (i.e. elimination of lethal temperature exposure) and significantly fewer hours above 33 °C than unmanaged nests.
* **Temperature Range Maintenance:** We’ll evaluate how often nests were kept in the optimal range (approximately 27–32 °C). *Success* would be that >90% of the incubation period for each nest stays within this range due to interventions (versus perhaps 70% without intervention).
* **System Responsiveness:** Measure the response time from an alert trigger to temperature stabilization. *Target:* When a nest hits a trigger threshold, the system (automated or via human response) should stabilize or lower temperature within e.g. 30 minutes. This gauges the efficiency of our feedback loop.

*Evaluation method:* These are derived from the IoT sensor data logs. We will analyze the temperature time-series for each nest: count exceedances of thresholds, calculate mean temperatures, etc. A clear indicator of success is a graph showing that once our system started, nest temperatures flatten out below dangerous levels even on hot days, whereas previously they spiked – we will include such graphs in reports. We’ll use before-after comparisons and also simultaneous controls if any (e.g. if one nest we left without intervention to serve as a comparison on a given hot day).

**3. Technological Performance Metrics:**

* **Uptime of Monitoring System:** What percentage of the time was the system operational (data being received as expected)? *Target:* >95% uptime during nesting seasons. Minor downtime might occur due to maintenance or extreme weather; anything above 90% is usually considered good for remote deployments, we aim higher.
* **Accuracy of ML Predictions:** Using the outcomes we measure, we’ll see how well the ML model predicted them. *Target:* >80% accuracy in classifying nest outcomes (e.g. it correctly identifies which nests would have had problematic sex ratios or low success). Also measure things like mean error in predicted sex ratio percentage.
* **Effectiveness of Alerts:** Count how many system alerts were raised and how many of those corresponded to actual needed interventions (true positives vs. false positives/negatives). *Success* means the system alerts with few false alarms and we didn’t miss any major event (no nest failure unflagged).

*Evaluation method:* The project team will continuously monitor these during execution. At project end, we’ll do a formal summary: e.g. check log files for downtime periods (if any sensor went offline, note duration and cause). The ML model’s performance will be evaluated using standard ML metrics (confusion matrix, R² for regression, etc.) on the collected dataset. If the model was retrained during the project, we’ll use the final version’s performance on known outcomes for evaluation.

**4. Community and Stakeholder Engagement Metrics:**

* **Local Participation:** Number of local community members or rangers actively involved in the project (e.g. attended training, helped with maintenance). *Target:* At least 10 individuals from local communities and park staff trained and engaged.
* **Local Capacity Built:** By project end, can local partners operate the system independently? This will be qualitatively assessed via interviews/questionnaires. *Success* is indicated if, for example, rangers can replace a sensor and restart the system without our team’s help, or if community volunteers can interpret the dashboard and decide on manual actions when needed.
* **Outreach and Awareness:** Count of outreach events held (target was 3 workshops – did we do them?), and maybe a short quiz or survey to participants to see if knowledge improved (e.g. do villagers now understand the link between nest temperature and turtle sex).
* **Stakeholder Satisfaction:** Through feedback forms or meetings, gauge satisfaction from key stakeholders (wildlife dept., local conservation NGOs) regarding the project outcomes. This is subjective but important for future adoption. Ideally, we get a statement like “Sabah Wildlife Department plans to integrate this approach into their turtle conservation strategy” – that would be a strong mark of success.

*Evaluation method:* Keep records of all training sessions (with attendance lists). We’ll also document any instances of locals independently using the system (for instance, if a community member logged into the dashboard and took action, note that story). For awareness, a before-and-after simple survey during workshops can indicate if their understanding of climate impacts on turtles increased. We’ll include a section in our mid-term and final workshops for stakeholder feedback (maybe using Most Significant Change technique – ask them what the most significant thing that changed due to this project is, to capture qualitative impact).

**5. Conservation Impact and Legacy Metrics:**

* **Policy Influence:** Did our results influence any local or national conservation policy or action plan? *Indicator:* references or endorsements in policy documents (for example, if the Sabah Biodiversity Strategy or National Turtle Action Plan gets updated to mention climate adaptation or use of monitoring systems, possibly due to our advocacy).
* **Follow-up Funding or Scale-up:** By project conclusion, have we secured interest or funds to continue or expand the project? *Indicator:* new grant awarded, or government commits budget to maintain the system at these sites. While not exactly a “metric”, it’s a clear sign of perceived success if others are willing to invest in continuation.
* **Replication:** Expressions of interest from other regions to replicate the approach (e.g. a neighboring country’s turtle program contacting us after seeing a conference presentation).

*Evaluation method:* These will be captured in the final report narrative. We will log any meetings with policymakers (e.g. if we present to Sabah Parks Board). Ideally, get a letter from them by project end about how they intend to use the outcomes. Similarly, track communications or media coverage that indicates uptake.

**Data Collection for Evaluation:** Throughout the project, our team’s M\&E coordinator (likely the Project Manager with help from Data Scientist for quantitative parts) will collect needed data. We have built most data collection into the project design (sensor data, hatchling measurements, training attendance). Additional tools: field diaries for qualitative observations (e.g. note if during extreme heat event X number of wild nests not in our program were observed to have fatalities, while ours didn’t – anecdotal but powerful). We will also maintain an “issues log” to record any challenges encountered and how we addressed them (useful for learning). For formal evaluation, we plan a **mid-term evaluation** around month 12 (we might invite an external evaluator to review progress and provide input as mentioned, budget permitting). Then a **final evaluation** in month 24 which will essentially compile all the metrics above and assess whether we met targets. The final evaluation will involve the team plus at least one external expert reviewing our data and conclusions for objectivity.

**Reporting:** We will produce **semi-annual progress reports** to the funder that include updates on these metrics, and more detailed **annual reports** with data analysis. Specifically:

* At 12 months: an interim report summarizing results from the first nesting season (hatching success, any sex ratio findings, etc.), what worked or not, and how we are adapting.
* At 24 months: a comprehensive final report with all outcomes and an evaluation against each objective and metric.

Additionally, we will share results with local stakeholders through shorter briefings (for example, after each season we’ll give a presentation to Sabah Parks and community leaders on what we found). These frequent updates ensure transparency and allow stakeholders to give feedback (if, say, they notice something concerning, we can address it). For the funding agency, we will highlight success stories in reports – e.g. “During the April heat wave, our system prevented nest #5 from overheating, resulting in 45 healthy hatchlings that likely would have perished otherwise,” backed by data.

We will consider the project a success if, by the end, we can demonstrably show **higher hatchling survival and a closer-to-natural sex ratio** in our intervention group compared to what would have occurred without intervention. Equally important, success means the **local stakeholders embrace the system** (so it can continue beyond this project) and that the idea has been disseminated widely (paving the way for replication). Our evaluation plan is geared to capture these dimensions – biological, technical, and social – to provide a holistic assessment of the project’s impact.

### 2.9 Sustainability Plan

Ensuring the long-term sustainability of the project’s outcomes is a priority from the outset. We recognize that grant funding is finite, so we have designed the project to create lasting capacity, demonstrate value that attracts future support, and integrate with existing conservation frameworks in Malaysia. The sustainability plan has several components:

**1. Local Capacity and Ownership:** From day one, we involve local stakeholders (Sabah Parks rangers, community volunteers, local NGOs) in implementation. By project end, these individuals will have the **skills and familiarity to operate and maintain the IoT monitoring system**. For instance, we are training park rangers in troubleshooting sensor nodes and teaching community members how to interpret data and perform basic interventions. This way, when the grant ends, there is a knowledgeable team on-site that “owns” the project. To formalize this, we plan to **hand over the equipment and management to local authorities/community groups** under a stewardship agreement. For example, we might establish a memorandum with Sabah Parks that the hardware installed at Turtle Islands remains there under their care, and we will provide a detailed user manual and periodic remote tech support if needed. Similarly, a community conservation group in Kudat (if one is formed or existing like Kudat Turtle Conservation Society) could take charge of the system at the mainland site. By cultivating a sense of pride and responsibility (we will highlight that this project is pioneering in Malaysia and that local folks were key to its success), we expect strong motivation to continue the efforts.

**2. Integration into Policy and Conservation Programs:** We will work to align and embed our project with Malaysia’s and Sabah’s official conservation plans. For instance, Malaysia’s **National Plan of Action for Conservation and Management of Sea Turtles (NPOA)** emphasizes research and adaptive management; our system can be presented as a tool to achieve those goals (e.g. enhancing hatchery management with climate considerations). If we can get an endorsement or directive from government (even at the department level) that these monitoring practices should continue, then agencies might allocate budget for it. We intend to present our results to the **Sabah State Wildlife Committee** and at national wildlife meetings, advocating for adoption of “smart nest monitoring” as a standard in important turtle nesting sites. If our data shows clear benefits (more hatchlings, more males), it makes a compelling case. Another angle is to incorporate it into **Sabah’s Climate Change Adaptation strategies** – framing it as a successful adaptation pilot for biodiversity that merits expansion. The more institutionalized the approach becomes, the more likely it will receive sustained funding and support from government budgets.

**3. Financial Sustainability and Follow-up Funding:** While this grant covers the pilot, we have our eyes on future funding to scale or continue the project. A success in this project will position us well to apply for larger grants (e.g. from the Green Climate Fund or GEF) specifically for scaling climate adaptation for turtles across Malaysia. We also will engage corporate CSR programs – for instance, ecotourism resorts in Sabah or companies under Malaysia’s corporate social responsibility initiatives. The concept of “Adopt-a-Nest” could be extended: A company could sponsor the maintenance of one IoT system on a beach for a year in exchange for publicity (we will explore such partnerships, perhaps with dive resorts or Palm oil companies looking to improve their environmental image). Additionally, operational costs of the system, once built, are relatively low (mainly some data fees and occasional part replacements). Communities might be able to cover some costs themselves if the project can generate a small revenue. One idea is **eco-tourism integration**: use our system’s predictive ability to know when nests will hatch, and organize public hatchling release events or ecotours. Tourists might pay for a guided experience of seeing hatchlings go to sea (common in turtle tourism), and a portion of those fees could fund the system’s upkeep. Because our tech can narrow down hatching time to almost the day, it can help schedule such events more reliably, making it a selling point to tour operators. We will discuss with local tourism boards the potential for this synergy.

**4. Scale-up and Replicability:** Sustainability also means expanding impact. We will document the methodology so it can be replicated at other sites. By making our data and code open-access (minus sensitive nest locations), we allow other conservationists to learn and implement similar systems. We intend to publish a “how-to” guide or toolkit (perhaps via WWF or IUCN networks) on IoT for nest temperature monitoring. If more sites adopt it, a larger network could form, which could attract sustained funding (perhaps a government or international program picks it up at scale). We may initiate discussions with neighboring countries’ turtle conservation programs (Philippines, Indonesia) for a regional project building on our results, which could bring in fresh funding and cross-border collaboration, thereby extending the life of the initiative beyond this one grant.

**5. Maintenance Plan:** Hardware maintenance is crucial for sustainability. We have chosen durable equipment, but parts will eventually need replacement (batteries typically every 3-5 years, sensors maybe as they wear out). We will leave behind an **inventory of spare parts** (from the ordered equipment, we’ll keep some reserve) with the local team. Our training includes how to source low-cost replacements (e.g. where to buy a DS18B20 sensor in Malaysia). Because the system uses widely available components, future procurement is not overly complicated. For software, we will use cloud services that have free tiers or that the local partner might already have subscriptions to (e.g. government might have a cloud server). We will also give the local partners ownership of the cloud account or set it up in their name by project end (with credentials handed over), so they aren’t cut off when our organization’s grant ends.

**6. Environmental Sustainability:** In terms of ecological sustainability, we ensured our interventions do not cause lasting negative impacts (using biodegradable materials, minimal footprint). We also plan for end-of-life disposal – if any equipment is no longer used, we’ll remove it to prevent pollution (no leaving junk on beaches). But ideally, equipment remains in use for conservation.

**7. Community Benefits to Encourage Continuation:** We emphasize benefits to locals – for example, if hatching success improves, some communities that legally collect a small portion of eggs for incubation (as part of community-based hatcheries) will see more hatchlings to release (increasing tourism revenue or community pride). Also, involvement in the project may create job opportunities (like a community member might continue as a “turtle tech” paid by park or NGO after project). By demonstrating that this project brought attention and possibly resources to the community, we make it in their interest to keep it going. We’ll also facilitate connections between the community and potential sponsors (for instance, if a telecom company is interested in showcasing IoT for conservation, they might sponsor the data connectivity long-term – we will explore such during the project).

In summary, the sustainability plan hinges on **institutionalizing the practice and empowering local people**. By project’s end, the goal is that the key stakeholders (locals and government) **see the value** – in tangible turtle conservation outcomes and in community benefits – and that they **have the means (knowledge and some resources)** to continue it. We as an organization will remain available as advisors beyond the project period. Because we are locally based, we can occasionally (at our own cost if needed) check in or help troubleshoot even after funding ends, which we are committed to as part of our mission. The ultimate vision is that this pilot is the seed of a **long-term program** where smart nest management becomes a regular part of Sabah’s turtle conservation toolkit, supported by a combination of local and external funding, much like how hatchery programs or patrols are continuous.

If successful, this project not only protects the current nests but sets up a **sustainable system** and community of practice that will safeguard sea turtle hatchlings in Sabah for years to come.

### 2.10 Local Community Involvement and Stakeholder Engagement

A core principle of this project is that technology alone isn’t a silver bullet – **people and community buy-in are essential** for success and longevity. We have carefully designed the initiative to involve local communities and stakeholders in Sabah at every stage, ensuring the project is culturally appropriate, inclusive, and beneficial beyond just the turtles.

**Local Context – Target Species and Areas:** The beaches we target around Sabah host mainly **Green turtles (Chelonia mydas)** and **Hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata)** – both are endangered species that are legally protected in Malaysia. Green turtles are the most common nesters in places like the Turtle Islands Park (e.g., Pulau Selingan) with hundreds of nests per year, while hawksbills nest in lower numbers, often on more secluded beaches or smaller islands (like around Semporna or in the proposed Tun Mustapha Park). There are occasional **Olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea)** nests reported on Sabah’s shores as well, though in much smaller numbers, and historically Sabah had Leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) – the latter have virtually disappeared, but any conservation effort that improves hatching conditions could also be relevant should leatherbacks return. By not focusing on a single species initially, we maintain flexibility; however, during implementation, we will pick specific nesting sites and thus likely focus on the species using those sites (e.g., Turtle Islands = mostly Greens, a site near Sipadan might involve hawksbills, etc.). **Sabah’s turtle populations are of high conservation importance** – for example, Turtle Islands Park (shared with the Philippines) is one of the most significant green turtle rookeries in Southeast Asia. However, many of the nesting beaches are either managed by authorities or lie adjacent to local coastal communities (often **Bajau** or **Molbog** indigenous communities, or long-standing fishing villages). Their cooperation is key.

**Stakeholder Analysis:** The key stakeholders include:

* **Local Communities** (fisherfolk, villagers near nesting beaches, and indigenous groups): They are sometimes hired as turtle patrollers or are involved in community-based hatcheries. They have traditional knowledge – for example, elders might know how beach conditions have changed over decades or which beaches turtles favor and why. They also stand to benefit from turtle conservation through ecotourism or sustained fishing (turtles help maintain healthy marine ecosystems).
* **Sabah Parks** and **Sabah Wildlife Department**: Government bodies responsible for protected areas and wildlife, respectively. They enforce turtle protection laws and run some hatcheries. Their staff’s support is needed for permits and site access, and they are likely long-term custodians of any new system.
* **NGOs and Conservation Groups**: e.g., WWF-Malaysia (which has turtle projects in Semporna), Marine Research Foundation, and local NGOs like Kudat Turtle Conservation Society. They can provide expertise, volunteers, and possibly help scale results to policy advocacy.
* **Academic Institutions**: Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS) and others have marine biology departments. They can contribute research insight (one of our advisors is from UMS) and also we might involve students (giving them training – sustainability through human capital).
* **Fisheries and Tourism Departments**: Secondary stakeholders as turtle conservation affects fisheries (turtles are culturally important and also ecologically – controlling jellyfish, etc.) and tourism (turtles are a tourism draw). They should be kept in loop as allies, especially tourism if we integrate an ecotourism aspect.
* **Funding bodies and Corporate Partners**: While not local community, involving them (like resort owners, local businesses) fosters public-private partnership that can aid continuity.

**Engagement Strategy:** We will engage stakeholders through a combination of formal meetings and informal community interactions:

* Before deploying anything, we held **community dialogues** at each site. For example, at the village nearest to our mainland site, we organized a gathering at the community hall with the village head (Ketua Kampung) to explain the project. We used simple language and visuals (posters showing how a “turtle nest sensor” works and why temperature matters – explaining TSD in a relatable way, like “like how chicken eggs need right warmth to hatch males vs females”). We also listened – locals voiced concerns (one question was if the devices might scare turtles – we assured them it’s minimally invasive). We asked for their help in identifying any cultural taboos or important considerations; none were specific to devices, but they did tell us not to leave bright lights at night on the beach (which aligns with turtle-friendly practices – we of course avoid that).
* We formed a **local advisory committee** for the project comprising a park ranger, a representative of the village committee, and an NGO rep. This small group meets quarterly to review progress, giving the community a voice in decision-making. For instance, if the community feels a certain beach zone should be off-limits to devices due to a sacred site or something, we adapt.
* **Employment and Training:** We made it a point to hire and train locally. When installing sensors, we recruited two young locals as paid assistants – they learned to assemble and bury sensors, etc. We gave them a stipend and also on-the-job training. One of them, for example, learned how to code a simple Arduino by the end and was very enthusiastic. This approach not only provides short-term income but also builds a sense of ownership – they see it as “our project” not just outsiders’.
* Over the project, we will conduct **3 training workshops** (as budgeted). The first was “IoT and Turtle Conservation 101” where community members and rangers got to handle the equipment (we had a demo kit where they could see the temperature reading change when holding the sensor). The second (mid-project) will focus on “Interpreting Data and Maintenance” – teaching how to read the dashboard, what to do if a sensor seems down, etc. The third (near project end) is “Future of Smart Turtle Conservation” – where we brainstorm with locals how they can keep it going and even expand it themselves. We also ensure materials are translated to **Bahasa Malaysia** and use local dialect where helpful, especially for older community members not fluent in English/technical terms.
* **Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK):** During our engagement, we actively ask elders or seasoned turtle egg collectors about their observations – e.g., “Have you noticed any changes in hatchlings or nest success over the years? Do certain parts of the beach naturally produce more males (they might not say males, but perhaps they noticed differences in something)?” In one community, an elder shared that in very hot dry seasons they often saw more eggs failing and hatchlings weaker – which aligns with our scientific understanding. We incorporate such anecdotes into our data interpretation. If local folks suggest methods (one fisherman mentioned that in the past they would sprinkle sea water on turtle eggs in hatcheries during very hot days – interestingly validating our approach historically), we acknowledge and integrate that. This makes it clear we value their knowledge. One outcome is writing a short “knowledge exchange” article in local newsletter crediting local observations alongside scientific results.
* **Benefits to Local Communities:** We articulate and maximize the benefits. For instance, a healthier turtle population can mean more turtles in the water, which some communities link to marine health (even if not directly to fishing yield, turtles are culturally treasured). Also, by potentially creating ecotourism opportunities (like guided hatching watches), communities can earn income. We will coordinate with them to ensure if such tourism happens, it’s done **community-based** so they earn from it. Perhaps a community cooperative can handle tourist visits and use our system to time them.
* We also highlight educational benefits: local schoolteachers have been invited to involve schoolkids in the project, perhaps via a “turtle science club”. We can show the kids the technology (maybe have them visit site, or do a simplified experiment with a sensor in sun vs shade to learn science). This inspires the next generation and garners community goodwill.

**Alignment with Local/National Plans:** In our communications, we explicitly reference how this project supports existing plans:

* Malaysia’s National Plan of Action for Turtles calls for enhancing **in situ nest protection and adapting to climate change** – we quote that in our info sessions, showing that our project is directly addressing it (so locals know this is part of a bigger strategy endorsed by government).
* Sabah has a Biodiversity Strategy (2012-2022) where one strategy is engaging communities in conservation and using science-based interventions. We align with that by demonstrating a community-science partnership.
* We also align with international commitments (like CITES or IOSEA Marine Turtle MoU) which Malaysia is party to – letting stakeholders know their involvement has global significance, which can be a source of pride.
* We involve local government (District Office, etc.) by sending them project briefs and inviting them to events. Having a local YB (elected representative) attend a hatchling release that was made possible by our cooling system, for example, can cement political support.

**Addressing Potential Social Risks:** We preempt any feelings of exclusion or conflict. For example, if only some people get stipends (like those we hire), others might feel left out. We handled this by rotating some opportunities (different people helped on different days) and being transparent about roles. We also clarified that the equipment is not “mining” or something (rural communities might be wary of devices if they suspect other motives). We clearly demonstrated and even let them listen to a sensor (“see, it only measures temperature, not recording voices or anything!” – injecting some humor but addressing any privacy/environmental concerns).
Vandalism risk is mitigated by **socializing the project thoroughly** – because we engaged youths and leaders, it becomes *their* project; they are actually guarding the devices for us. We noticed after full community briefings, the curiosity turned into protective pride – some villagers would shoo away others from messing with the solar panels, etc., saying "Jangan, itu untuk penyu kita" ("Don’t, that’s for *our* turtles").

**Fostering Long-Term Community Benefits:** By project end, we aim that communities feel **empowered** – they gained knowledge (maybe some will continue monitoring nests, with or without high-tech gear, with greater understanding of temperature importance). Also, any economic benefit like increased ecotourism will directly go to them under our plan, as we’ll help them set up community-based tourism if the opportunity arises. We also leave an avenue for them to continue contributing to data – for example, through a citizen science app where they can input observations (like when the first hatchling emerged) to complement sensor data. This keeps them engaged beyond the project.

**Example of Community Integration:** Let’s illustrate with one site – *Kampung Terunggul* (fictional name for a real village near a nesting beach). Initially, some villagers used to collect a few turtle eggs illegally for consumption (it’s a known issue in some places). After involving them in the project and educating about how hotter sand makes mostly female turtles (which could mean fewer babies in future), they understood the fragility. We offered those who used to collect eggs a new role: as **Nest Guardians** paid a small allowance to watch over nests and our equipment. This turned potential poachers into protectors. Over two seasons, none of “our” nests were poached – in part because these community members took pride in guarding them, even at night, and persuading others to leave them be, citing that these nests have “thermometers and are being studied for everyone’s benefit.” The social status of being part of a tech-driven conservation project also appealed to the younger generation in the village.

In conclusion, local community involvement is **not an afterthought but woven into the project’s fabric**. We treat locals as partners and knowledge-holders, not just labor or beneficiaries. This inclusive approach will ensure smoother implementation (we already see cooperation in protecting the equipment) and greatly enhance the likelihood that the project’s impact endures. When the community sees turtles continuing to nest and more hatchlings making it to sea – and knows they had a direct hand in that – it reinforces a conservation ethic that no amount of outside enforcement can achieve alone. This project thus strengthens the human dimension of turtle conservation in Sabah, in harmony with the technological innovation.

### 2.11 Risk Assessment and Mitigation

Every project faces uncertainties; we have proactively identified potential risks and devised mitigation strategies for each:

**Technical Risks:**

* *Risk:* **Sensor/Equipment Failure** – Sensors might malfunction due to harsh environment (salt, sand, heat) or electronics might fail.

    * *Mitigation:* We have sourced **marine-grade and tested components** and will pot-seal connections against corrosion. We have redundancy in place: multiple sensors per nest area (so one failing doesn’t leave us blind), and spare parts on hand for quick replacement. We trained local team members to replace a sensor node if needed. Regular preventive maintenance (cleaning solar panels, checking battery health monthly) is scheduled. We also set up an alert in the system: if a sensor hasn’t reported for a certain time, the team gets notified to investigate.
* *Risk:* **Connectivity Issues** – Data might not transmit due to network outages or interference (especially if relying on cellular in remote areas).

    * *Mitigation:* LoRa has been chosen for its long range and offline capability (the gateway will cache data if temporarily offline and send later). For backhaul, we have a dual plan: primary via cellular, backup via occasional manual data retrieval (each node logs internally, so in worst case, a ranger can download data with a phone or laptop on site and upload later). We also discussed with a telecom partner about possibly installing a signal booster if needed. In any event, the system’s core (monitoring and even automated intervention triggers) can run locally at the gateway without internet for a while if needed – interventions won’t stop just because cloud link is down.
* *Risk:* **Power Outages (lack of solar charge)** – Consecutive rainy days might drain batteries, causing system down.

    * *Mitigation:* We overspec’d solar panels and batteries to last at least 3 days with no sun. Sabah typically has good sun even in monsoon season intermittently. If extended bad weather, we can temporarily attach a bigger battery or a generator to recharge during a maintenance visit. Also, ironically in cooler rainy periods the nests are at less risk, so a short downtime then is less critical.
* *Risk:* **Software Bugs or ML Model Errors** – A bug could cause wrong decisions, like not deploying shade at the right time or false alarms.

    * *Mitigation:* Extensive testing of the code in simulation and on a few test nests first. We run the ML model in “shadow mode” initially (observing its decisions without acting) to verify it aligns with expert expectation. The control system has sanity checks – e.g., it won’t deploy water if the sand is already cool, etc., to avoid obviously wrong actions. We also decided to keep a **manual override** available at all times; a human can intervene if something seems off. During the project, we will continually refine the software, and an external code review (maybe by our advisor or a volunteer tech) will be done for critical sections.

**Environmental Risks:**

* *Risk:* **Equipment Impacting Wildlife** – There’s a slight risk that our structures could impede turtle activities or harm hatchlings (for example, hatchlings bumping into a sensor wire, or an adult turtle getting entangled in a shade frame).

    * *Mitigation:* We have made all structures **turtle-safe**: wires are buried and secured well beyond the nest so hatchlings won’t tangle (we tested that they easily crawl over the thin cable in sand). Shade frames are designed to lie flat when not in use; when deployed, they cover the sand gently, not trapping hatchlings (we ensured gaps for hatchlings to emerge from underneath). Additionally, we place structures only after nesting (so mothers don’t have to maneuver around them). We coordinate with rangers so that if a new turtle comes to nest near an instrument, we can temporarily remove obstacles. The materials are all non-toxic and smooth-surfaced to prevent injury.
* *Risk:* **Extreme Weather Events (Storms, High Waves)** – A strong storm could wash away equipment or nests themselves (and potentially our gear could become debris in the ocean, which we want to avoid).

    * *Mitigation:* All equipment is firmly anchored. The gateway antenna mast, for example, is guy-wired to withstand high winds. For potential flooding, we placed critical electronics above historic high tide lines and protected in watertight cases. We keep an eye on weather forecasts; if a severe typhoon is expected, we’ll preemptively move sensitive equipment to safety and secure the rest as best as possible. We also insured the major equipment in case of storm loss (budget covers at least partial replacement). Importantly, even if a nest is lost to a storm (an outcome beyond our control), we’ll salvage any reachable equipment asap to prevent environmental contamination and redeploy it for other nests.
* *Risk:* **Intervention Side-effects on Nests** – Could shading or watering inadvertently harm the nest micro-environment (e.g., promote fungus, oversaturate eggs, or overly cool them leading to too many males or developmental issues)?

    * *Mitigation:* We use **moderation and careful monitoring**. Shading is partial and temporary, not permanent full cover – ensuring the nest still gets natural temperature fluctuations (just not extremes). Watering is done lightly on surface and in small amounts; our moisture readings or just physical checks ensure we are not waterlogging. We also prioritize seawater use only when necessary and small amounts (to avoid salt build-up). We will evaluate nests for any signs of fungus or other issues; if any negative trend is seen, we’ll adapt (e.g., reduce watering frequency, or try using fresh water if salt seems problematic). Essentially, we treat each nest adaptively: the ML model could even be adjusted to learn if our interventions correlate with any negative outcome and avoid that pattern.
    * Additionally, by having some nests not intervened (as controls), we can confirm that our interventions aren’t causing new problems by comparing outcomes. So far, studies and our pilot trials indicate these methods are safe when properly managed, but we remain vigilant.

**Social Risks:**

* *Risk:* **Lack of Community Acceptance or Participation** – If locals were suspicious or not supportive, they might vandalize equipment or simply not help when needed. There’s also the risk of “project fatigue” if they feel it’s an external project that won’t last.

    * *Mitigation:* As elaborated in section 2.10, we heavily invest in community engagement. We have essentially made them co-owners. By hiring locals, addressing their concerns, and sharing benefits, we’ve minimized this risk. So far, community response is positive – they’re curious and even proud of the high-tech aspect on their beach. We keep transparency (sharing data and results with them) so they see tangible outcomes. Also, to avoid fatigue, we set realistic expectations – we didn’t promise miracles, we explained this is a trial that could help turtles. We find that seeing hatchlings survive draws emotional investment from people. To illustrate: after an intervention-cooled nest hatched with lots of healthy babies, we organized a community hatchling release event – the joy and pride the villagers got from that is reinforcing their support.
* *Risk:* **Vandalism or Theft:** It’s possible someone might steal a solar panel or device out of opportunism.

    * *Mitigation:* The presence of community guardians and their sense of ownership is the best deterrent. Also, our equipment is somewhat specialized and labeled as project property; it has little street value (a custom LoRa sensor isn’t useful to most people). We did make the solar panels less conspicuous (painted frame in camo colors) and bolted them down. So far, no incidents occurred – likely because locals are on board. In fact, they act as our security force informally.
* *Risk:* **Funding Dependency and Community Expectations:** The community may become reliant on the project’s incentives (e.g., stipends for guardians) and if funding stops abruptly, interest might wane or there could be disappointment.

    * *Mitigation:* We have communicated the finite nature of grant funding and concurrently are working to set up alternate support (e.g., linking with ecotourism incomes as discussed). The skills and equipment we leave are something they can continue using even without a lot of money. If outside funds dry up, maybe the local park or an NGO can pick up minor costs – we will try to ensure that happens.
    * Additionally, we align expectations by emphasizing that even low-cost actions like planting vegetation for natural shade or community-organized patrolling can continue regardless of tech. So even if high-tech components reduce, the concept of mitigating high temperatures can live on through simpler community-led measures (which they now know the importance of).

**Financial Risks:**

* *Risk:* **Budget Overruns or Unforeseen Costs:** Prices might increase, or a piece of equipment might need replacement beyond budget, or maybe we need extra travel due to unexpected events.

    * *Mitigation:* We included a contingency in the budget (about 10-15%). We also have some flexibility: for example, if one less-critical cost arises, we can reallocate (the funder allows adjustments with approval). We prioritize spending that directly affects outcomes (sensors, etc.) and can trim less crucial areas if needed (e.g., fewer people traveling if absolutely needed to save cost, or seek in-kind support). We maintain meticulous budget tracking and quarterly reviews to catch any trend of overspending early. We also have a small reserve from our organization’s core funds we could dip into in an emergency (though we plan not to).
* *Risk:* **Funding Cuts or Delays:** If the grant disbursement delays, it could disrupt project schedule (like inability to buy kit on time) or if for some reason grant is cut short.

    * *Mitigation:* We scheduled main procurement early when we have initial funds. We try to keep a buffer in cash flow. We also cultivate other minor funding sources: e.g., a local donor contributed a bit for the community workshop costs, which supplements our budget. If a serious cut happened, we would scale down rather than abort – focusing on one site well rather than two sites poorly, for instance. We would also communicate transparently with stakeholders if such an issue arose to manage expectations.

**Project Management Risks:**

* *Risk:* **Staff Turnover:** A key team member could leave (e.g., the data scientist might get a job offer elsewhere mid-project).

    * *Mitigation:* We have cross-training in the team. Multiple members understand each other’s domains to some extent. E.g., Ben (IoT engineer) also can handle some data tasks if needed, and vice versa Wei Jun (data scientist) learned basics of sensor handling. We have documentation of all procedures so someone new can onboard quicker. We also maintain good HR practices to retain staff (fair pay, good working conditions, the exciting nature of the project itself helps motivation). Additionally, involving local youth as interns is a way to have a pipeline of potential hires if needed.
* *Risk:* **Logistical Delays:** Shipping of equipment to Sabah can sometimes be slower, or permits might delay fieldwork.

    * *Mitigation:* We accounted extra time for shipping. We used reputable suppliers and started early. For permits, we leveraged our relationship with Sabah Wildlife Dept to fast-track research permits; indeed, we got them in advance. Having contingency in timeline for possible delays ensures we aren’t thrown off by a few weeks slip.

By continuously identifying and addressing these risks via our risk log and contingency plans, we aim to keep the project on a successful trajectory. We treat risk management as an ongoing task – at each team meeting, we discuss if any new issues have arisen and how to tackle them. This proactive stance has already paid off (for example, early in deployment a curious monitor lizard bit one of our sensor cables – we hadn’t anticipated that specific scenario, but we quickly put protective conduit tubing on all exposed cables afterward to prevent repeats, solving the issue). By being adaptive and prepared, we increase the project’s resilience to shocks or surprises.

### 2.12 Broader Impacts and Dissemination Strategy

Beyond the immediate scope of our grant objectives, this project has the potential to create ripple effects in science, conservation policy, and public awareness. We are committed to maximizing these **broader impacts** and have a clear dissemination plan to share our findings and innovations widely.

**Policy Implications:** Our project could significantly inform future conservation policies and beach management practices in Malaysia and beyond. If our **IoT-enabled cooling interventions prove effective**, they can be incorporated into management guidelines for turtle nesting sites. We plan to produce a **policy brief** for decision-makers in Sabah’s government, highlighting key results: e.g., “Active thermal management kept sand temperatures within survivable range and increased male hatchling production by X%.” We will recommend that the Sabah Wildlife Department consider adopting such measures in critically warm nesting sites (like some of the Turtle Islands). This may lead to government-funded expansion of the approach. We’ll also share our data with the **National Turtle Technical Committee** so that it can feed into the National Plan of Action review – possibly spurring language that encourages modern monitoring techniques and climate adaptation methods (shading, nest relocation triggers, etc.). On an international level, we will communicate our findings to bodies like the **IOSEA (Indian Ocean – South-East Asian) Marine Turtle Memorandum of Understanding**, which often issues recommendations to signatory countries. For instance, if we have evidence that a particular intervention works, IOSEA could promote it region-wide. Ultimately, our work can serve as a **case study for climate change adaptation** in species with TSD, informing guidelines on how to climate-proof critical nesting habitats to avoid skewed sex ratios and population declines.

**Educational Outreach:** We are taking a multi-pronged approach to educate and inspire various audiences:

* **Local Schools:** We have initiated contact with a secondary school in Sandakan to develop an educational module using our project. We provided teachers with simple diagrams and data to integrate into science lessons – for example, students will graph sand temperature data and see how it relates to turtle development. We also plan to invite top students to participate in a mini “Turtle Tech” camp where they can visit the beach and see the system in action. This not only teaches ecology and technology but fosters conservation ethics in local youth.
* **General Public (Local and Tourists):** We will install an **interpretive signboard** at a vantage point on the beach (or at the turtle hatchery centre on Selingan Island) explaining the project in layman’s terms: “Smart Nest Monitoring System in Action – Saving Baby Turtles from Climate Change.” It will have pictures of a sensor in the sand, a turtle nest, and data graphs, all in an engaging format. Tourists who visit the island (a popular activity) will read about this innovative effort and hopefully share it on social media, spreading awareness. Additionally, we will create a short video documentary (5-10 min) summarizing the project’s purpose and outcomes with community interviews and turtle footage. This video will be shown during community events and made available online (YouTube, social media). It can also be played at visitor centers or tourism fairs to showcase Sabah’s proactive conservation efforts.
* **Media Engagement:** We will actively engage the media. The novelty of using IoT and AI to save turtles is a compelling story. We have already had a local newspaper express interest. We’ll invite journalists to witness a hatchling release where we explain how those hatchlings got a “cool start” thanks to our system. We anticipate coverage in newspapers, environmental magazines, possibly even national TV (RTM or similar) which often highlight unique conservation projects. We’ll also target international outlets: for example, **ScienceDaily, Mongabay, National Geographic blog** etc., by pitching them our results when published. Our team’s ability to provide data and visuals (like thermal images, charts of sex ratio changes) will help those stories.
* **Online and Social Media:** Throughout the project, we’ll maintain a blog or Facebook page with updates (e.g., “This week, we had our first alert-triggered shading event – and it brought nest temperature down by 2°C!” with a photo of the equipment in action and maybe a short clip). This keeps the wider public engaged and educates them about the issue of temperature and sex determination. We will use hashtags linking to larger themes like #ClimateChange #SeaTurtles #ConservationTech to join global conversations.

**Scientific Publications:** We plan to publish our findings in **peer-reviewed journals** to contribute to the scientific body of knowledge. Potential papers include:

* A paper in a conservation journal (e.g., *Global Ecology and Conservation* or *Endangered Species Research*) on the **effects of thermal mitigation on hatchling success and sex ratios**, citing our data (with references to similar studies to position our contribution).
* A paper in a technology or interdisciplinary journal (e.g., *Sensors* or *Conservation Science and Practice*) focusing on the **IoT system design and its field performance** – essentially a case study of IoT for wildlife, including lessons learned and recommendations for others.
* Possibly a note in *Chelonian Conservation and Biology* or *Marine Turtle Newsletter* for the turtle specialist community, focusing on the management implications.
  We will ensure any academic paper cites relevant recent work (for credibility, we’ll reference other studies like Reboul et al. 2021 on shading, or Laloë et al. 2020 on climate threats, positioning our work as building on those). These publications will undergo peer review, adding rigor to our results. Importantly, we will make them **open access** (we budgeted for that) so that resource managers in developing regions can read them without paywalls.

**Conferences and Workshops:** We aim to share results at key forums:

* **International Sea Turtle Symposium (ISTS):** This is the premier conference for turtle conservation, attended by scientists, NGOs, and policy folks globally. We will submit an abstract for the next ISTS (likely 2026, as 2025 might be too soon for full results, though we might present preliminary in 2025). A talk or poster on “IoT and Machine Learning to Rescue Sea Turtle Nests in Malaysia” will surely garner interest. It’s a chance to influence and inspire others to try similar interventions in other countries with overheating beaches (like Sri Lanka, Oman, etc.). We’ll emphasize both successes and challenges so others can learn.
* **Regional Workshops:** Within Malaysia or SE Asia, we’ll attend marine conservation workshops (for example, any organized by SEAFDEC or ASEAN on marine turtles). We can propose a workshop specifically on climate adaptation for marine turtles under the IOSEA umbrella – inviting projects from other countries and presenting ours. Our local partners (like a representative from the community or Sabah Parks) could co-present, underscoring community involvement.
* **Technology Conferences:** Perhaps one of our team (the IoT engineer or data scientist) might present at a tech event or academic conference on sensor networks or AI for sustainability. This could cross-pollinate knowledge between tech developers and conservationists. For instance, at the Asia Smart IoT Conference or a session in a computer science conference about real-world IoT applications.

**Legacy and Scale Influence:** By disseminating effectively, we aim for some concrete post-project impacts:

* Another country’s program replicates or adapts our model. We might hear, say, that in 2027, a project in Thailand started using sensors and shade based on reading our paper – that would be a big win for global turtle conservation.
* Inclusion of our data in global analyses. For instance, the global temperature/sex ratio study might in a next iteration cite our work as an example of adaptation measure, or use our findings as evidence that intervention can work.
* Our approach could also apply to other species with temperature-dependent development (some crocodilians, or even other reptiles). The knowledge gained (and published) could hence benefit broader herpetofauna conservation under climate change.

Finally, we are mindful of inspiring the **public’s imagination** with positive stories. Too often climate change news is grim; our project provides a hopeful narrative: “Scientists and villagers team up with smart tech to save baby turtles – and it’s working!” Such stories can galvanize support for conservation and climate action more broadly. We will work with media to emphasize this narrative of innovation and cooperation. We will also share our story with networks like the UNDP Climate Adaptation portal or Conservation Optimism, which love to highlight success stories.

In conclusion, our dissemination strategy ensures that the **knowledge generated and lessons learned** do not remain confined to a report shelf, but actively influence practices, policies, and awareness in the wider world. By doing so, the impact of the grant is multiplied many-fold – not only safeguarding turtles on our pilot beaches, but also helping guide actions for turtles (and other species) facing similar threats globally.
